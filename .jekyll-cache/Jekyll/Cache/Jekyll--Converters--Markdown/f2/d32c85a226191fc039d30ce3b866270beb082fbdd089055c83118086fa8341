<h2 id="the-selfish-gene">The Selfish Gene</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>is a 1976 book on evolution by Richard Dawkins, in which he builds upon the principal theory of George C. Williams‚Äôs Adaptation and Natural Selection (1966). Dawkins uses the term ‚Äúselfish gene‚Äù as a way of expressing the gene-centred view of evolution as opposed to the views focused on the organism and the group, popularising ideas developed during the 1960s by W. D. Hamilton and others. From the gene-centred view, it follows that the more two individuals are genetically related, the more sense (at the level of the genes) it makes for them to behave selflessly with each other.</p>

<h2 id="chasing-new-horizons-inside-the-epic-first-mission-to-pluto">Chasing New Horizons: Inside the Epic First Mission to Pluto</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>In January of 2006, a tiny one-thousand-pound spacecraft, mounted on top of a powerful 224-foot-tall rocket, blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Thus began the longest and farthest journey of exploration our species has ever attempted‚Äîa journey to explore Pluto, the last of the unvisited planets known at the dawn of the Space Age. That spaceship, aptly named New Horizons, carried the hopes and dreams of a team of scientists and engineers who had poured much of their lives into what had‚Äîat many times‚Äîseemed an improbable quest.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There were many reasons that some expected Pluto to be a relatively dead world, geologically speaking. After all, it is such a small planet, and it lacks the tidal heat sources that being in a giant planet‚Äôs satellite system would provide. Also, it is far from the Sun and solar heating is weak. So, by the conventional wisdom born of exploring the rest of the solar system, Pluto should have been largely or even completely geologically inactive for eons. But the conventional wisdom was seriously wrong. New Horizons found a wide range of surface ages, ranging from ancient and heavily cratered to completely fresh-looking areas with no craters at all‚Äî meaning that Pluto has been geologically active throughout its 4- billion-year history. In fact, Pluto has been alive and kicking throughout history, and is even today. Why that is so is the subject of intense scientific debate and modeling, and it portends that we can expect more surprises when other small planets in the Kuiper Belt are explored.</p>

  <p>A process doesn‚Äôt know where it is located in RAM or, in general, whether a particular part of its memory space is currently resident in memory or held in the swap area (a
reserved area of disk space used to supplement the computer‚Äôs RAM). Similarly, a process doesn‚Äôt know where on the disk drive the files it accesses are being held; it
simply refers to the files by name. A process operates in isolation; it can‚Äôt directly
communicate with another process. A process can‚Äôt itself create a new process or even end its own existence. Finally, a process can‚Äôt communicate directly with the input and output devices attached to the computer. By contrast, a running system has one kernel that knows and controls every-thing. The kernel facilitates the running of all processes on the system. The kernel decides which process will next obtain access to the CPU, when it will do so, and for‚Ä¶</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The remarkable feature of simple programs is that a significant percentage of them are capable of producing great complexity. Simply enumerating all possible variations of almost any class of programs quickly leads one to examples that do unexpected and interesting things. This leads to the question: if the program is so simple, where does the complexity come from? In a sense, there is not enough room in the program‚Äôs definition to directly encode all the things the program can do. Therefore, simple programs can be seen as a minimal example of emergence.</p>

This is what analog will spit out for the browser overview for the domain resizecalc.somestuff.org, what can we conclude from here? (this is for july 08)

a. lots of komunists coming in, and they all use Firefox  
b. msnbot seems to be really interested in video conversions, i see that as an abuse from big company to small person.  
c. people are still using IE  
d. Safari is there as well

p.s. the pie is almost identical for jun08

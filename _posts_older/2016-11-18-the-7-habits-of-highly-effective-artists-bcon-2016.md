> The vast majority of great works throughout history were created by consistently working, every day, over a long period of time.

> Volume, Not Perfection  
> “The odds of producing an influential or successful idea, are a positive function of the total number of ideas generated.” –Simonton, Originals
> What’s more, the longer you spend trying to perfect your work, the less you’re learning.

> Good stealing is when you study the work of many artists and combine them to make something new.  
> ...looking at your inspiration file will remind you of why you’re doing it. And it will also provide valuable reference when you’re unsure of how the pros do a certain thing.

> Conscious Learning  
> this habit is (in my opinion) the hardest to adopt, because it involves going towards pain, which our brains are wired to avoid.

> Rest  
> After a certain point, working harder is actually pointless. Because your eyes become blind to the work’s problems.

> Get Feedback

The ability to get feedback will make you a rockstar

> Create What You Love

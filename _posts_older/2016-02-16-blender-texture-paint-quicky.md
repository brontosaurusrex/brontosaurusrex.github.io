title: Blender texture paint quicky
---

> Setting up for texture paint isn't overly complicated. In simplest form using the cube and Cycles, unwrap cube using      
> desired method, doesn't really matter. Then open UV editor with cube still in edit mode and Click New to add a new texture
> under the UVs. Next, open node editor and drag and drop the texture into the nodes. Set Texture Paint mode and paint. (check tutorials for more)
> I learned that one from JA12, then drag and drop from image editor dropdown menu to node editor. I suspect not many others
> know of that little shortcut.                

Stolen from irc.

title: "Why > STFU (or answer to everything)"
---
Some questions have not yet been answered.  
a. What is life?
b. What is conciousness?
c. What is time?

a. Acording to Dawkings (Selfish Gene) it started with replicators (primitive versions of DNA) which were more or less random answer to natural stability of certain things, then some mutants of this early stuff replicated better (for example the ones with some sort of overlay/skin) and so on.

> At some point a particularly remarkable molecule was formed by accident. We will call it the Replicator. It may not necessarily have been the biggest or the most complex molecule around, but it had the extraordinary property of being able to create copies of itself

b. According to a. not much (side product of better versions of the replicators?) Could be human "reality" perception error.

c. Uhmm, yeah, anyone? (interesting start might be black holes where you cannot exit due to time "changing" into vector pointing towards singularity, but can't really develop that further). Or Einstein and his space time continuum.

So the real question might be:  
d. Why is there something and not nothing?  
or e. Could there be just nothing?  
which may lead to  
f. Why?  
(Adams tryed here with numerical/computerish 42 and creativistic 'We apologize for the inconvenience')
**To which the most obvious answer is probably STFU.**

**Why > STFU (=answer to everything).**

(It is not like that you personally should stfu, more like all the replicant infected beings could/should/might)

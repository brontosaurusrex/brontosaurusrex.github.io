title: Markdown editors for linux

> Markdown is a simple markup language. It’s lightweight and easy to learn. If you haven’t seen any markdown document yet, just head over to GitHub and enter any open-source project. The readme file almost certainly will be written using Markdown.

Btw: Geany 1.28 (backports) has a markdown preview plugin, but it suffers from default ugliness (a lot).

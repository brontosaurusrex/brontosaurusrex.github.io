    I have no reason to trust you. On
    the other hand, I have absolutely
    nothing to lose. I could easily
    arrange to have John invited to
    give a paper at the conference.
        MAGGIE
    Do you think he would accept?
        GEORGETTE
    Zizek is speaking. He loves Zizek.

        JOHN
    Zizek is speaking...
        MAGGIE
    Oh you love Zizek!
        JOHN
    (baffled)
    How do you know?
        MAGGIE
    I--I think I heard you mention him.

        JOHN
    How are you making out?
        AL BANTWAITHE
    Itâ€™s tremendous. We all came up
    here just to hear you speak. And
    Zizek, obviously.

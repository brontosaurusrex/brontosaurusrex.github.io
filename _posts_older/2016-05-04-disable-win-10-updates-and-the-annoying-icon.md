title: disable win 10 updates and that icon

GWX Control Panel

> This is a free tool that can remove and disable the 'Get Windows 10' notification area icon on Windows 7 and Windows 8. Recent versions can also disable 'Upgrade to Windows 10' behavior in the Windows Update control panel and do much more. See the user guide at the Ultimate Outsider blog.

p.s. The amount of annoyance I feel to have to work with windows again is another story (probably a hefty book fat).

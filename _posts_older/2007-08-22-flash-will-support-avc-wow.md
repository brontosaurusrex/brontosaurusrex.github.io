quote:_There are still a couple of bugs with frame ordering/timing I need to fix in the Flash Player itself for the final release. And there is also a problem with files using the loop filter on dual core machines which causes horizontal artifacts along slice boundaries, which is my bad. The fix for this did not make it into this beta. Overall though and leaving out the bugs I listed here which are my fault, the H.264 decoder is a remarkable piece of engineering, it is provided to us by MainConcept. It weights in at less than 100KB of compressed code which is quite an achievement for such a complicated standard._

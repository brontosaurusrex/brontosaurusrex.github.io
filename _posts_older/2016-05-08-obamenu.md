> obamenu automagically creates complete openbox menus based on looking at, analyzing, and working on xdg information provided by most applications. Being badass fast obamenu can be included as a dynamic item in menu.xml (example is in the docu) providing the user with an always up to date menu. In case you install a new application, simply have obox restart (which takes ~ 1 second) to find the new application right away in the manu.

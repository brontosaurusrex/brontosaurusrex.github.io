From that slashdot thread

> For many, working with an object-oriented terminal is immensely more preferable to having to wrangle text.

> As for other shells... bash and other bournes are nice, but they handle data like shit and you spend most of your time coding new utilities for almost everything you need to accomplish.

> I think that existing shell paradigms weren't good enough for handling these tasks. Most shells don't have the ability to call libraries without additional utilities. Most shells don't have the ability to employ data structures. PowerShell while somewhat grotesque to look at is really quite powerful in that sense.

> And objects, big fucking deal. I've been using Bourne variants for a quarter of a century and never thought "Boy, I wish I had classes".

> You don't really have Linux admins saying, "Man, I wish I had Powershell!" as much as you have Windows admins saying, "I spent all this time making Powershell scripts. I wish I could run the same scripts on Linux." They're servicing their own users, and providing extra value in learning to use Microsoft technology.

> No Linux admin, who administers standard Linux bare metal or VMs is going to install this, not in a million years, they've got bash scripts with GNU utils, or they learnt Python or Perl or something else years and years ago, they've no use for PowerShell..

sIBL type of lightning is supposedly supported in blender  
<http://hdrlabs.com/sibl/archive.html>  
<http://hdrlabs.com/sibl/framework.html>  

The idea is to have multiple images

- a super high res panorama as camera background
- a high res HDR as specular component for reflection
- a blurred low res HDR as diffuse environment lighting  
and a
+ sun lamp.

quote;  
_* Command-line interfaces are better for more complex actions, which you want to repeat (and possibly automate) and/or which you want to affect many objects. They are closer to the shell level: command-line interfaces take more advantage of our capacity for expressing complex thought in language.</p> 

* GUIs are better for using direct manipulation, and for using the selected object to narrow down the range of possible actions. GUIs take more advantage of our ability to quickly perceive and interact with images. </i>

There was a script that would open multiple urxvt windows, like this for example
[![urxvtgrid.th.png](https://scrot.moe/images/2016/07/18/urxvtgrid.th.png)](https://scrot.moe/image/nacU)

(Another/Min example would be 2-3 windows on top of each other with slight margins and with max-width in pixels and min-width in percents)

similar, but not exactly there yet

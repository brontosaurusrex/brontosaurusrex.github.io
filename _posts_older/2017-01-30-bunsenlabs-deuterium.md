couldn't agree more, however it is not 100% clear if this a trendy thing or something more stable.

edit: Now my 1st real test was to get this to run on Debian Stretch, but something went wrong and the virtualbox got stuck in lightdm, staring at the penguin/bunsen logo. Hopefully that will not be in the final release (ututo did [a wonderfull new logo](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/viewtopic.php?id=3029), no penguins there).

## element

Also a building block for so called "heavy water".

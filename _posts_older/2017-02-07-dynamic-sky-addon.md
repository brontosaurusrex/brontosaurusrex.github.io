Not sure why it is called dynamic, since it seems like one needs to build a "new world" with every setting change (or doodle with world noodles). Looks a bit worse than your average hdri light, also a bit slower. But I'll assume it is procedural, so there should be no aliasing/resolution-dependant problems when rendering.

This blog should now be [https](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) (enforced).

> HTTPS consists of communication over Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) within a connection encrypted by Transport Layer Security or its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer. The main motivation for HTTPS is authentication of the visited website and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data.

Which doesn't mean much on this static site

> In practice this means that even on a correctly configured web server, eavesdroppers can infer the IP address and port number of the web server (sometimes even the domain name e.g. www.example.org, but **not the rest of the URL**) that one is communicating with, as well as the amount (data transferred) and duration (length of session) of the communication, though **not the content of the communication**.

but I can claim that I do feel so httpsish today. (It was hard to do that, I had to [press a button](https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https/)).

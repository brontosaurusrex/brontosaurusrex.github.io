Since i could not find any recent x264 compiles online, here is my try (thanks to x264 developer Dark Shikari and enthusiasts for helping me out with this, also thanks to people on #macdev for some very usefull hints);

<pre lang="text">x264 --help
x264 core:85 r1442 781d300
Syntax: x264 [options] -o outfile infile [widthxheight]

Infile can be raw YUV 4:2:0 (in which case resolution is required),
  or YUV4MPEG 4:2:0 (*.y4m),
  or Avisynth if compiled with support (no).
  or libav* formats if compiled with lavf support (yes) or ffms support (yes).
Outfile type is selected by filename:
 .264 -> Raw bytestream
 .mkv -> Matroska
 .flv -> Flash Video
 .mp4 -> MP4 if compiled with GPAC support (yes)

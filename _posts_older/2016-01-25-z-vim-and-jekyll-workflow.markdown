p.s. What I would actually want is editor independent workflow, a script like:

    script new

would open properly named and front-matter populated file in $editor1 or $editor2 (both user configured)

    script list

will list last N files in current directory (with numbers to select which one to open)

    script last

last one

    script "search term"

would either open the one file matching the term or list them all for selection.

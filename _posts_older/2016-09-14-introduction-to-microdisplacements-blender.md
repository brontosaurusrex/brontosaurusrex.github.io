> This is one of the most exciting developments to come to Blender in recent years.

> It’s two separate features that work together:  
> **Adaptive Subdivision** – Automatically subdivides objects based on the amount of screen space they take up  
> **Micropolygon displacement** – Uses the adaptive subdivision to displace the geometry at the time of rendering.

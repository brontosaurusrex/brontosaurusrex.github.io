_Three different worldviews – three different ways in which they “search for the sacred”.</p> 

In their book The New Universe and the Human Future, authors Nancy Ellen Abrams and Joel Primack use the scientific story of the evolution of the universe as the backdrop for us to move towards a shared creation story. In their book, they offer a definition of spirituality that really resonated with me. They see it as “**experiencing our true connection to all that exists.**”

I like that. No matter what our worldview, that definition seems to fit.

I also like these words from 20th century mystic and spiritual teacher Ernest Holmes. He wrote, “there is no stagnation in Spirit, nor should there be any in our idea of spirituality. **To be spiritual is to create! The Spirit is alive, conscious, aware and active.**”

So here is the interesting interconnection that I see in regards to our investigation into the meaning of what it means to be “spiritual”. No matter what our worldview, there is **some call within each of us that pushes us on a search for meaning, for the sacred, for understanding**.

Depending upon our worldview, the search can take us into traditional religions, into scientific understandings, or into seeking our own path to truth. The search can take us externally into life seeking truth and the sacred “out there” or it can take us internally looking for the divine in the sacred within us. Yet no matter where we search, we are all called to an experience of our true connection to all that exists.

We should place no limits on what it means to be “spiritual” nor any idea of spirituality. The power that urges us along our search is alive and well within each of us. It’s in me. It’s in you. It’s in everyone you meet. The fact that our individual searches for the sacred appear differently to others is only an indication that there is no stagnation in Spirit. The fact that we are all on a search for the sacred binds us in oneness. We are all creative and we are all spiritual in our own beautiful and perfect way!</em>

> Rather than make a video about color correction, I looked hard for an easy way to create filmic and cinematic grades without any effort, and this is the result. I don't use LUTs or plugins, just the built-in Lumetri color tool with Adobe Premiere Pro. You can do the same in FCP-X or Avid, and you can also apply these concepts to high-end grading applications like DaVinci Resolve, Adobe Speedgrade, Baselight and Nucoda.

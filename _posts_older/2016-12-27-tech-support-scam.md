Narration/Storytelling is interesting on more than one layer, mostly it is a question (a game) of **trust** I guess. 

Interesting details from some of the catchers where 'Microsoft' is supposed to be something trusted and 'MS certificated guy' is not. 

And from the opposite side there is this '[seven layer firewall](https://openclipart.org/image/2400px/svg_to_png/63019/expert-fire-wall.png)', [just](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/robot-and-shield.jpg) [hillarious](http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/849ca8918dfea9abf29a19e8a0238054-970-80.jpg).

A sad clash of two cultures, slam-dog millionaire vs 'Legit' Microsoft generation (Not sure which one is worse).

**Each&Everything** nicely translates to another side of the ocean to the **Rich&Fat**.

Now go and find that **ctrl + žblj** on your keyboard, ... sir.

Don't worry sir, I'am usually wrong.

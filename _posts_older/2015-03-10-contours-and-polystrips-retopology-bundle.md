Contours

The Contours Retopology tool is an addon for Blender that provides quick and easy ways retopologize cylindrical forms. Use cases include organic forms, such as arms, legs, tentacles, tails, horns, etc.

The tool works by drawing strokes perpendicular to the form to define the contour of the shape. Immediately upon drawing the first stroke, a preview mesh is generated, showing you exactly what you’ll get. You can draw as many strokes as you like, in any order, from any direction.

Polystrips

The Polystrips Retopology tool is an addon for Blender that provides quick and easy ways create the key face loops needed to retopologize a complex model. Use cases include complex forms, such as human faces, creatures, and other organic & hard-surface objects.

The goal of Polystrips is to provide a fast and artist-friendly method of mapping out the crucial topology around complex forms, allowing the remaining areas to simply be filled in.

The tool works by hand-drawing strokes on to the high-resolution object. The strokes are instantly converted into spline-based strips of polygons, which can be used to quickly map out the key topology flow. Clean mesh previews are generated on the fly, showing you the exact mesh that’ll be created.

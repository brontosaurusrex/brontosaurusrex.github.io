> I actually have a special adapter as well (male microUSB to 3 female USB ports and 1 male USB port). Remember some things that you want to connect require power above what the device can provide and thw device battery will drain fairly quick and the male USB port is useful because you can have it permanently on charge.

Edit: Well, definitely working, since I'am writing this with keyboard attached to my android tablet:

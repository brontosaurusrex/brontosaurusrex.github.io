title: How nice
---
    ps ax -o pid,ni,cmd
    
This will list the process ID, the nice level, and the actual command.

example

    nice -19 java -jar sheepit.jar -ui text -login brontosaurusrex -password *****
    
will run sheepit with LOWER priority. 

p.s. This is the solution for an old I5 (Debian/openbox) with merely 4 gigs of ram to run sheepit 24/7, ram is a bit limiting with firefox thought (sheepit can easily eat 2-3 gigs).

unrelated: One can add -cache-dir /some/path/cache1 to change working dirs, but each node seems to need its own dir, also everything inside will get wiped, so carefull.

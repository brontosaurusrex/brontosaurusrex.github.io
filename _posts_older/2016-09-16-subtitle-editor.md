> Subtitle Editor is a GTK+3 tool to edit subtitles for GNU/Linux/*BSD. It can be used for new subtitles or as a tool to transform, edit, correct and refine existing subtitle. This program also shows sound waves, which makes it easier to synchronise subtitles to voices.

It is called [_subtitleeditor_](http://home.gna.org/subtitleeditor/) in Arch (0.53.0) and Debian (0.33.0) repos. It can transform 23fps to 25fps (Even srt to srt).

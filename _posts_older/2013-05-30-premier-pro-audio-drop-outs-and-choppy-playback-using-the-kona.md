Premiere Pro > Preferences > Audio Hardware

Set that to anything **OTHER** than AJA Kona. I have it set to Built In Audio.

In System Prefs > Audio Output I have it set to AJA Kona.

Yes, that&#8217;s a weird setting in the Audio Hardware but that&#8217;s where it needs to be.

As for the choppiness, we have that on our four core machine and have determined that the four core will not work with ProRes footage playing back through the AJA Kona. An 8 core machine works just fine.

As a test though, bring up your Activity Monitor and the CPU Activity. See if the cores max out when trying to play back the footage with the AJA Kona being used for output.</em>

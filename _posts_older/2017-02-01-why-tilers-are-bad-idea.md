title: Why tilers are bad idea
tags: linux
---
- window is at the wrong place
- window has wrong width/height
- window has wrong margin/padding
- use of mouse is limited
- bad compatibility with other wm stuff (tint2)
- extreme workflow jump when everything else uses floating paradigm

Imho the only software that uses tiling pardigm at least half-correctly is Blender (yeah, not a wm).

_Been working with 2 setups to achieve best quality analogue sound from a Media PC. Anyone who is comparing soundcards with Logitech speakers etc, Using Digital Out, headphones under £300 or using anything under a £4000 hifi then browse away because your will not be listening in the same way as i what to hear music. Sorry dont want to make offense.</p> 

In one set up i have a Auzentech X-Plosion with LM4562NA opamps, which feed a Musical Fidelity Power Amp (£1500), Via Pure Silver Nordost Cables (£1000), Kimbre Cable 8TC speaker (£80/m) cable to Audio Physic Speakers (£2000). I have been very impressed with the sound from this card, and at times sounded better than my Tom Evans Eikos CD player (£1800). However when i used Reclock and enabled Kernal Streaming the sound quality was improved, Music had a vail lifted with greater depth and space, with nuances rendered with increased accuracy.</i>

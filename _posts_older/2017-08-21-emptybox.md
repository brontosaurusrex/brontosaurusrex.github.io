That menu is will show on super+tab or midle-mice-button on desktop.

It appears as if default W-x is set to change desktops, but you can comment that out and add something like that under running apps

    <keybind key="W-x">
      <action name="Execute">
        <startupnotify>
          <enabled>true</enabled>
          <name>xkill</name>
        </startupnotify>
        <command>xkill</command>
      </action>
    </keybind>
    
This will change cursor to crosshair waiting to xkill whatever target it may click. Xkill is part of x11-utils in stretch.

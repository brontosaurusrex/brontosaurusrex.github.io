title: 50p to 50i the cheap way in Adobe Premiere
---
Two things and a half:

a. RMB on clip, field options, enable flicker removal  
b. In effects set Anti-flicker to 1,00.  
c. Gaussian Blur = 2 (maybe)

p.s. 50i means 25 frames per second interlaced.

p.s.2. This was relatively cheap camera, aerial wide-lens stuff.

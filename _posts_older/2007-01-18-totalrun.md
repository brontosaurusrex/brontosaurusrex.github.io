_With this program you can run your own totalcmd in any pc (example from an usbkey), even if it have already (or not) Total Commander installed with different settings and owner. Usefull to help friend on their own pc without losing your favorite file manager, full of customised button, 2000 of ftp entries, 100 of wcx-wfx-wlx files. In other words it runs Total Commander and a lot of other programs (even if his original location is changing), through an virtual drive with a FIXED letter._

very cool!

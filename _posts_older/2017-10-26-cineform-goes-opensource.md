> The CineForm codec has been in development for 16 years, overseeing many innovations in the video production market: it ushered transition from standard definition to HD, and it was the first to do cinematic compression for RAW capture beyond HD. From there, it became first and only editing codec to support 3D/Stereoscopic. The CineForm codec then ushered the transition from HD to 4K, and now, 360Â° video beyond 4K

title: 2016 useless blog stats
---
Number of posts written

    ls 2016* | wc -l
    334
    
Number of words written (that's including machine generated markdown headers, markdown itself and a lot of quoting)

    cat 2016* | wc -w
    16304
    
Which would take one full floppy of disk space (thats text only, no images)

    du -ch 2016* | tail -1
    1.4M	total
    
Actually the real size is much smaller

    du -chs --apparent-size 2016* | tail -1
    169K	total

And with some tar.xz

    tar -cvJf 2016.tar.xz 2016*
    du -h --apparent-size 2016.tar.xz 
    60K	2016.tar.xz

So that floppy should last for a while.

    (1440 kilobytes) / (60 kilobytes) = 24 years

Wordcloud analysis  
"Blender" and "Debian" are part of wings, eye is shaped like "USB" and "data" is on the backside.

"x264" is leveled with usb and kinda illustrates the input of the lightwave. Every video done this year (lots) had x264 (h.264) versions as well.

"Terminal" and "apt-get" seems to be part of the heart <s>digestive system</s> and "video" is on the neck. "Sudo" seems to be the center (chi) of the creature. "Ffmpeg" seems to be stuck in the .... And so on. 

Just under "Blender" there is a fat "Will" which probably suggest that future will be better.

At the top of the head there are "random", "film" and "thingy".

Chin area features small "1920x1200" and wings are showing way bigger "3440x1440", a definitive feature of the 4k year ahead.

"Media" is way to small (at least "correct" is almost decent size).

"Github" is stuck at the almost extreme end of the tail (also way to small). 

"Hardware", "volumetric" and head-down "progress" are parts of small brain.

There is also "PBR" at the top-middle of the wing suggesting that cycles quality is my problem (That's Blender rendering engine). 

"Using" and "crontab" are on the top of the neck, where crontab deserves way larger font really (Kinda unfair, since there is really not a lot to write about software that works as it should).

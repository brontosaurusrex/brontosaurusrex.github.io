> For starters, you need an external storage drive, such as an HDD, SSD or a flash drive.
You also need a Raspberry Pi. Models 1 and 2 work just fine for this application but you will get a little better support from the Raspberry Pi 3. With the Pi 3, you're still limited to USB 2.0 and 100Mbps via Ethernet. However, I was able to power one external HDD with a Pi 3, while the Pi 2 Model B could not supply enough power to the same HDD.

This would make sense if we are talking about the need for TERAbytes. Otherwise a sane solution seems to be a 128gb (or bigger) microsd card.

(keeping the small form-factor of entire unit and cable-ness).

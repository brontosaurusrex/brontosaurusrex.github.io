## Kwrite 

does look awesome, font rendering is way better than say geany (And it actually understand I'd like light version of font), but lacks line-height setting and obviously tabs (No I don't want kate).

## notepadqq 

is quite awesome, has tabs and has line-height settings and font rendering is great, but seems to be missing mini-map.

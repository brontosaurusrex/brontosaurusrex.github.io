_Libre Graphics World is a blog on free applications for digital painting, graphic and web design, desktop publishing, photography and CAD. We focus on news, tutorials and articles to provide you most up to date information about evolution of these applications and best practices.</p> 

Free software is a rapidly evolving niche, we feel that this fact should be better represented on the Web which is exactly what we do. In many ways foundation of this project was triggered by Ginger Coons’s talk “Ownership and Standards: Why Designers are Slow to Adopt Open Source”.</em>

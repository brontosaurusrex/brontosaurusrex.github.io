> Einstein's theory of gravity---general relativity---was the last great pillar of pre-quantum physics. Gravity, he says, results from the curvature of spacetime in the presence of massive objects like stars. Then lighter particles moving nearby just travel along the straightest possible routes that they can through this curved geometry, called geodesics. And yet over 200 years earlier  Newton wrote down a vastly si...

But despite this, these intelligent primates are regularly snatched from their forest homes and exploited as attractions in wildlife shows. Wildlife tourism is a multi-billion-dollar industry, and thanks to the rise of the selfie, it’s growing every year. But what’s really going on behind the scenes? We meet some of the orangutans suffering for selfies, and one of the lucky few to escape.

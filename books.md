## The Selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins - 1976)

> is a 1976 book on evolution by Richard Dawkins, in which he builds upon the principal theory of George C. Williams's Adaptation and Natural Selection (1966). Dawkins uses the term "selfish gene" as a way of expressing the gene-centred view of evolution as opposed to the views focused on the organism and the group, popularising ideas developed during the 1960s by W. D. Hamilton and others. From the gene-centred view, it follows that the more two individuals are genetically related, the more sense (at the level of the genes) it makes for them to behave selflessly with each other.

## To Explain the World (Steven Weinberg - 2015)

> A masterful commentary on the history of science from the Greeks to modern times, by Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Weinberg—a thought-provoking and important book by one of the most distinguished scientists and intellectuals of our time.

## Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration ( Edwin Catmull and Amy Wallace - 2014)

> Creativity, Inc. is a book for managers who want to lead their employees to new heights, a manual for anyone who strives for originality, and the first-ever, all-access trip into the nerve center of Pixar Animation—into the meetings, postmortems, and “Braintrust” sessions where some of the most successful films in history are made. It is, at heart, a book about how to build a creative culture—but it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, “an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.”

## ReWork: Change the Way You Work Forever (Jason Fried - 2010)

> Rework is the perfect playbook for anyone who's ever dreamed of doing it on their own. Hardcore entrepreneurs, small-business owners, people stuck in day jobs who want to get out, and artists who don't want to starve anymore will all find valuable inspiration and guidance in these pages.

## CSS MASTER (Tiffany B Brown - 2015)

> TIFFANY B. BROWN, CSS has grown from a language for formatting documents into a robust language for designing web applications. Its syntax is easy to learn, making CSS a great entry point for those new to programming. Indeed, it's often the second language that developers learn, right behind HTML.

## Tesla: Man Out of Time (Margaret Cheney - 1981)

## Unix history (Brian W Kernighan - 2019)

Only a shared file system

> Development of Unix did not actually begin as work on an operating system. Rather, the small group of computer scientists who had seen their positions on the Multics project evaporate at Bell Labs' exit set out to create a file system that could be shared efficiently within their workgroup. The operating system was little more than an afterthought resulting from a need to test this file system.

Taking out the ideas that were known, but for some reason not implemented before

> Thompson made it clear that there were certain aspects of the file system on the Multics project that he would have liked to see happen, but which were never implemented. A major example is "treating files and devices the same... having the same read calls." This meant that terminals would input and output data in the same format that mainframes did, leveling the playing field between users on different computers.

Pipes

> The idea of standard input and output for devices eventually found its way into Unix as pipes. Pipes enabled users and programmers to send one function's output into another function by simply placing a vertical line, a &#124; between the two functions.

Being free and selfish and an actual user of the product

> This concept of building tools for one's own benefit, and adapting them to fit the needs of the group also stood out in Thompson's interview, as he explained his motivations for working on Unix. "I was more interested in myself. Just selfish notions of trying to get a environment to work in."

Even vague descriptions may forge a "revolution"

> The basic construction of the compiler, of the co-generator for the compiler, was based on an idea that I heard about from someone at the Labs at Indian Hill — I never actually did find and read the thesis, but I had the ideas in it explained to me so that the co-generator for NB was... based on this Ph.D. thesis.

More about pipes

> Most of the programs up until that time couldn't take standard input, because there wasn't the real need. They had file arguments. grep had a file argument, cat had a file argument. Thompson saw that that wasn't going to fit into this scheme of things, and he went in and changed all those programs in the same night. I don't know how. In the next morning we had this orgy of 'one-liners.' Everybody had one-liner. 'Look at this, look at that.'

grep

> One afternoon I asked Ken Thompson if he could lift the regular expression recognizer out of the editor and make a one-pass program to do it. He said yes. The next morning I found a note in my mail announcing a program named grep.

Little languages

> According to the broad definition given by Kernighan, software tools such as eqn, tbl, and make can be considered little languages. Scripting languages are also little languages because they simplify tasks that would otherwise become complex under a full-scale language such as C.

> One such scripting language, awk, was developed by Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Kernighan to be used for "simple one or two-line programs to do some filtering as part of a larger pipeline."5 The modern language perl, a prominent scripting language used on the World Wide Web, is a descendant of awk. Kernighan explains the origins of awk:

Portability (Also bringing up higher level language C and ditching assembler) also assumes it should run on less powerfull hardware

> Unix came into many CS departments largely because it was the only powerful interactive system that could run on the sort of hardware (PDP-11s) that universities could afford in the mid '70s. In addition, Unix itself was also very inexpensive. Since source code was provided, it was a system that could be shaped to the requirements of a particular installation. It was written in a language considerably more attractive than assembly, and it was small enough to be studied and understood by individuals. (John Stoneback, "The Collegiate Community," Unix Review, October 1985, p. 27.)


## Alan Turing and his contemporaries, Building the world’s first computers (Martin Campbell-Kelly - 2012)

> Whilst mercury delay-line storage systems were being developed at NPL, Cambridge and elsewhere, another line of research had been started in America. Engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) had attempted to memorise, or store, a radar scan using electrostatic charges inside a cathode ray tube (CRT). (1946)

^ This one is probably not worth reading, besides those little interesting pieces of computer history info.

## "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!" (Ralph Leighton and Richard Feynman - 1985)

Anecdotes, but the main idea is 'how to think about things'.

> It's nice that I got some money ­­ I was able to buy a beach house ­­ but altogether, I think it would have been much nicer not to have had the Prize ­­ because you never, any longer, can be taken straightforwardly in any public situation.

## Chasing New Horizons: Inside the Epic First Mission to Pluto (Alan Stern and David Grinspoon - 2018)

> In January of 2006, a tiny one-thousand-pound spacecraft, mounted on top of a powerful 224-foot-tall rocket, blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Thus began the longest and farthest journey of exploration our species has ever attempted—a journey to explore Pluto, the last of the unvisited planets known at the dawn of the Space Age. That spaceship, aptly named New Horizons, carried the hopes and dreams of a team of scientists and engineers who had poured much of their lives into what had—at many times—seemed an improbable quest.

> There were many reasons that some expected Pluto to be a relatively dead world, geologically speaking. After all, it is such a small planet, and it lacks the tidal heat sources that being in a giant planet’s satellite system would provide. Also, it is far from the Sun and solar heating is weak. So, by the conventional wisdom born of exploring the rest of the solar system, Pluto should have been largely or even completely geologically inactive for eons. But the conventional wisdom was seriously wrong. New Horizons found a wide range of surface ages, ranging from ancient and heavily cratered to completely fresh-looking areas with no craters at all— meaning that Pluto has been geologically active throughout its 4- billion-year history. In fact, Pluto has been alive and kicking throughout history, and is even today. Why that is so is the subject of intense scientific debate and modeling, and it portends that we can expect more surprises when other small planets in the Kuiper Belt are explored.

## Space Odyssey - Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke, and the Making of a Masterpiece (Michael Benson - 2018)

> HAL’s red eye was actually a Nikon 8-millimeter wide-angle lens lit from behind.

> On hearing that they still hadn’t figured out how HAL could overhear them, Lyndon looked at Dullea and Lockwood as though it was the most obvious thing in the world. “He could just read your lips,” he said. There was a moment of thunderstruck silence. “God, that’s a great idea!” Kubrick exclaimed. They had their answer.

## Memory Machines - The Evolution of Hypertext (Belinda Barnet - 2013)

> [Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart) believes that human beings live within an existing technical and cultural system, an ‘augmentation’ system. We are born with a particular set of genetic capabilities, and then we build on these innate capabilities using tools, techniques, skills, language and technology. There is no ‘naked ape’; from the moment we are born we are always already augmented by language, tools and technologies. This augmentation system defines the limits of what is possible for us as a species.

> One dream in particular has recurred throughout this book: a device that ‘enables associative connections that attempt to partially reflect the ‘intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain’ (Wardrip-Fruin 2003, 35). More precisely, a tool for thought – a tool that might organize the mass of deeply tangled data that surrounds us. For the world grows more and more complex every day, and the information we are expected to keep track of proliferates at every click. How are we to keep track of the mess? The problem that Bush identified in 1945 is just as urgent today.

## The Linux Programming Interface (Michael Kerrisk - 2010)

> In this authoritative work, Linux programming expert Michael Kerrisk provides detailed descriptions of the system calls and library functions that you need in order to master the craft of system programming

> A process doesn’t know where it is located in RAM or, in general, whether a particular part of its memory space is currently resident in memory or held in the swap area (a
reserved area of disk space used to supplement the computer’s RAM). Similarly, a process doesn’t know where on the disk drive the files it accesses are being held; it
simply refers to the files by name. A process operates in isolation; it can’t directly
communicate with another process. A process can’t itself create a new process or even end its own existence. Finally, a process can’t communicate directly with the input and output devices attached to the computer. By contrast, a running system has one kernel that knows and controls every-thing. The kernel facilitates the running of all processes on the system. The kernel decides which process will next obtain access to the CPU, when it will do so, and for...

## A New Kind of Science (Stephen Wolfram - 2002)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Kind_of_Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Kind_of_Science)

> The remarkable feature of simple programs is that a significant percentage of them are capable of producing great complexity. Simply enumerating all possible variations of almost any class of programs quickly leads one to examples that do unexpected and interesting things. This leads to the question: if the program is so simple, where does the complexity come from? In a sense, there is not enough room in the program's definition to directly encode all the things the program can do. Therefore, simple programs can be seen as a minimal example of emergence.

A long book, quasi sci-fi, I made the cloud read it to me out loud (AWS polly).

## The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet (Becky Chambers - 2014)

> Life aboard the Wayfarer is chaotic and crazy—exactly what Rosemary wants. It’s also about to get extremely dangerous when the crew is offered the job of a lifetime. Tunneling wormholes through space to a distant planet is definitely lucrative and will keep them comfortable for years.

Another sci-fi.

## The God Equation: The Quest for a Theory of Everything (Michio Kaku - 2021)

> The God Equation: The Quest for a Theory of Everything is a popular science book by the futurist and physicist Michio Kaku.

It was an easy read, Kaku knows how to deal with mortals. I did miss the futuristic part a bit. To my old self it feels I read at least 10 similar books in the previous years. Up to date (I hope) and with all the resources nicely quoted at the end. Also I don't care about anthropic principles (this surely must all be wrong?) or I don't understand how this must be applied to real stuff (experiments). The voices from cloud also read this to me (amazon polly).

p.s. The good futuristic part is Ligo put in space, multiple satelites linked with lasers that will listen to the voices of big bang, or (drums) voices from the mother universe - start of creation - god doing its dice thing.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle)  
> In 1961, Robert Dicke noted that the age of the universe, as seen by living observers, cannot be random.[9] Instead, biological factors constrain the universe to be more or less in a "golden age", neither too young nor too old.[10] If the universe were one tenth as old as its present age, there would not have been sufficient time to build up appreciable levels of metallicity (levels of elements besides hydrogen and helium) especially carbon, by nucleosynthesis. Small rocky planets did not yet exist.

No. 

## The Testaments (Margaret Atwood - 2019)

[From wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Testaments)  
>  It is a sequel to The Handmaid's Tale (1985).[2] The novel is set 15 years after the events of The Handmaid's Tale. It is narrated by Aunt Lydia, a character from the previous novel; Agnes, a young woman living in Gilead; and Daisy, a young woman living in Canada.[3]

From the book   
> When I'd first begun reading these files, I was appalled and sickened. Was someone trying to cause me distress? Or were the files part of my education? Was my mind being hardened? Was I being prepared for the tasks I would later be performing as an Aunt? 

> This was what the Aunts did, I was learning. They recorded. They waited. They used their information to achieve goals known only to themselves. Their weapons were powerful but contaminating secrets, as the Marthas had always said. Secrets, lies, cunning, deceit-but the secrets, the lies, the cunning, and the deceit of others as well as their own. 

Praise be.

## Based on a True Story: (Not) A Memoir (Norm Macdonald - 2016)

> “This sketch is gonna be big, Lorne, real big. Comedy is about what people relate to, and everybody has an answering machine. My God, did you even read it?”

> “Yes, I read it, Norm, but it’s hardly a sketch. First of all, the host is barely in it. Sandler and Farley have no lines at all. As far as I can tell, it’s just you talking about how you don’t answer your phone anymore and how, later, you tell the person who phoned that you never got the message and that they must have left it on someone else’s answering machine. Then Sandler and Farley laugh for an uncomfortably long time.”

> “Right, they laugh for a long time because what I’m saying is really funny.”

> “Well, wouldn’t it be a better idea to let the audience decide whether it’s really funny?”

>“With all due respect, Lorne, I think that would be the worst thing we could possibly do. Believe me, I’ve been down that road before.”

## Project Hail Mary (Andy Weir - 2021)

> Thinking rationally, you can't make spaceships without a civilization and you can't have civilization without being able to communicate. So of course they have language.

## Let's Eat Grandma's Pills (David Thorne - 2022)

> “Okay, but are you 800% pleased?”

[goodreads:](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/45252)  
> The year is 2380. The Intersolar Commonwealth, a sphere of stars some four hundred light-years in diameter, contains more than six hundred worlds, interconnected by a web of transport "tunnels" known as wormholes. At the farthest edge of the Commonwealth, astronomer Dudley Bose observes the impossible: Over one thousand light-years away, a star... vanishes. It does not go supernova. It does not collapse into a black hole. It simply disappears.

## Binti (Novella by Nnedi Okorafor - 2015)

From wikipedia:  
> The novella has 3 sequels. The first, Binti: Home, was released on January 31, 2017. The third installment, Binti: The Night Masquerade, was released in January 2018, and was nominated for the 2019 Hugo Award for Best Novella. Subsequently, DAW/Penguin/PRH published an omnibus edition of the three novellas with an additional short story titled "Binti: Sacred Fire", which serves as an interlude between Binti and Home.

> A young woman named Binti is the first member of the Himba people from Earth to be accepted into the prestigious intergalactic university Oomza Uni. Upon being notified of her acceptance, Binti runs away from home and boards a transport ship to Oomza Uni.

## Dealers of Lightning: Xerox PARC and the Dawn of the Computer Age (Michael A. Hiltzik - 1999)

From chatgpt:  
> chronicles the groundbreaking innovations at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) during the 1970s, which laid the foundation for the personal computing revolution. The book delves into the creative minds and transformative inventions that emerged from PARC, profoundly shaping modern technology.

Xerox PARC's main innovations include:

* Graphical User Interface (GUI): The development of user-friendly interfaces with windows, icons, and menus, which became the standard for personal computers.
* Ethernet: A pioneering networking technology that allowed computers to communicate over a local area network (LAN).
* Laser Printing: The creation of the first laser printer, revolutionizing document printing with high-speed and high-quality output.
* Personal Computer (Alto): The design and development of the Alto, one of the first personal computers, featuring a GUI, mouse, and network capabilities.
* Object-Oriented Programming: Advances in programming paradigms, including the development of the Smalltalk programming language, which emphasized objects and modularity.
* Bitmapped Displays: Innovations in display technology that allowed for the use of high-resolution graphics on screens.

## Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution - 25th anniversary edition (Steven Levy - 1984/2010)

> To a hacker, a closed door is an insult, and a locked door is an outrage. Just as information should be clearly and elegantly transported within a computer, and just as software should be freely disseminated, hackers believed people should be allowed access to files or tools which might promote the hacker quest to find out and improve the way the world works. When a hacker needed something to help him create, explore, or fix, he did not bother with such ridiculous concepts as property rights. 

1st generation Hacker Ethics (TL;DR):  
* Information should be free (passwords are unnecessary).
* Computers should be decentralized (a humorous stance towards IBM and timesharing concepts).
* Mistrust authority.
* Oppose bureaucracy.
* You can create art and beauty on a computer.

## Annie Bot (Sierra Greer - 2024)

Goodreads:  
> Doug says he loves that Annie’s artificial intelligence makes her seem more like a real woman, but the more human Annie becomes, the less perfectly she behaves. As Annie's relationship with Doug grows more intricate and difficult, she starts to wonder whether Doug truly desires what he says he does. In such an impossible paradox, what does Annie owe herself?

Too silly for 2024, yet intriguing enough to keep you reading.

## 	All Systems Red - The Murderbot Diaries (Martha Wells - 2017)

"As a heartless killing machine, I was a complete failure."

Wikipedia:  
> A scientific expedition on an alien planet goes awry when one of its members is attacked by a giant native creature. She is saved by the expedition's SecUnit (Security Unit), a cyborg security agent. The SecUnit has secretly hacked the governor module that allows it to be controlled by humans and has named itself Murderbot, as it is heavily armed and designed for combat. However, it prefers to spend its time watching soap operas and is uncomfortable interacting with humans.

## Artificial Condition - The Murderbot Diaries #2 (Martha Wells - 2018)

Wikipedia:  
> Murderbot hacks its way onto unmanned cargo ships to travel toward the mining facility where it once malfunctioned. It hopes to learn more about the initial incident in which it went rogue, of which it has little memory. Murderbot reluctantly befriends the unexpectedly powerful, intrusive bot that pilots the research transport in which it is making the final leg of its journey to RaviHyral, the station where the incident occurred. Murderbot allows this artificial intelligence—which it has dubbed ART (Asshole Research Transport) due to its sarcastic personality—to make physical modifications to the SecUnit's body that will better allow it to pass for an augmented human, and to disconnect the data port at the back of its neck which had been used to insert a combat override module in the previous book.

ART rocks.

## Rogue Protocol - The Murderbot Diaries #3 (Martha Wells - 2018)

Wikipedia:  
> Murderbot makes its way to a recently abandoned GrayCris terraforming facility in orbit over the planet Milu to collect further evidence of the company's past crimes. Befriending a pet-like humanoid bot named Miki as a means to keep its presence hidden, the SecUnit secretly follows a team of humans sent to assess the facility before a new company takes possession of it. Murderbot is forced to reveal itself when the humans are attacked by a hostile combat robot and one of the researchers is captured.

    cd . # untested

Other, suggested by chatgpt (all untested):

> If you suspect that the directory listing is being cached by your shell or file system, you can try one of the following commands to force a refresh:

    ls -alF --color=never

> The -F flag adds a trailing character to each filename to indicate the type of file, such as a slash for directories. The --color=never option disables colorized output, which may be cached by your shell. This command may force a refresh of the directory listing.

    find . -maxdepth 1

> The find command searches for files and directories within a specified path. In this case, the . specifies the current directory, and the -maxdepth 1 option limits the search to the current directory only. This command can also force a refresh of the directory listing.

    sync && echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

> This command clears the kernel's page cache, which may be caching directory information. It requires root privileges, and may take a few seconds to complete.

> Note that these commands may have side effects, such as resetting your shell's command history or causing some file system operations to be slower, so use them with caution.

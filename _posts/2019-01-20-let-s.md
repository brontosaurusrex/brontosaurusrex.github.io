> Many OSS teams find themselves building project and community management tools from scratch

No, we have github.

> the author never planned to be responsible for a critical piece of digital infrastructure.

That's the big fun of the OSS. In other words I don't particularity care if you can run my scripts or not.

> OSS contributors are often on the receiving end of harassment, demands, and general disrespect

Or the other way around, they disrespect users (human nature, nothing to do with OSS.)

> Inadequate resources

True, I'll happily take all the resources you can provide via fully anonymous system (but thanks for github, It was pretty cool so far).

> Beyond download statistics, maintainers have limited visibility into how their software is used.

I would prefer not to know any kind of statistics and I believe that should be a goal for every developer (or human generally).

> Communities are not always well-equipped to guide that evolution.

So what. Other way of dealing with things is via giant evil-company umbrella?

It looks like a cute form, but no thanks.

> I can’t wait to talk to you.

See you around.

I like this function:

    needs() {
    command -v "$1" > /dev/null || { >&2 printf "%s is required- not installed or in PATH; %s\n" "$1" "${@:2}"; return 1; }
    }

which according to chatgpt could be even nicer:

    needs() {
    if ! command -v "$1" > /dev/null; then
      >&2 printf "%s is required but not installed or not in PATH. %s\n" "$1" "${@:2}"
      return 1
    fi
    }

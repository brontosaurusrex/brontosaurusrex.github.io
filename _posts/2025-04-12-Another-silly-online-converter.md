## Cons

> File converters have always disappointed us. They're ugly, riddled with ads, and most importantly; slow. We decided to solve this problem once and for all by making an alternative that solves all those problems, and more.

I can't find any settings for file conversion, so lol.

> All your files are converted completely on-device; this means that there's no delay between sending and receiving the files from a server, and we never get to snoop on the files you convert.

When uploading cineform.mov, file the thing told me that there will server upload and then crapped out on conversion (supposedly due to not recognizing cineform?)

## Pros

There is source code.

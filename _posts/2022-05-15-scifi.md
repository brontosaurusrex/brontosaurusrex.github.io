Mostly Blender microdisplacement and some pJSplacement (and post with fotosketcher and some photoshop). 3440x1440 px.

## Breakdown

Geometry nodes generate 'random' blob, which is then turned into tetris peace with the help of remesh modifier, hi-res details are then added with the microdisplacement texture.

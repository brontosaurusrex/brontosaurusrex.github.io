- There are $GOROOT and $GOPATH (both empty if go is installed using apt). $GOPATH is a place for resource stuff and can be compound multipath (Like $PATH), idea being separation of external resources vs user code.

- Source files should use .go extension.

- workspace is nothing special, but src, bin and pkg (intermediate binary) folders have meaning.

Example structure for an app:

    go (workspace)
        bin
        src
        └── github.com
            └── brontosaurusrex
                └── firstapp
                    └── Main.go
        pkg

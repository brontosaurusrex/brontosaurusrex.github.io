[Drop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brontosaurusrex/stretchbang/master/bin/drop) clips/urls from chrome/youtube to mpv playlist.

[![drop.md.png](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=//cdn.scrot.moe/images/2019/02/07/drop.md.png)](https://scrot.moe/image/aclZQ)

## What it does  
- Waits for urls or files to be droped (Can be closed after the fact and mpv shall continue)
- Add those to mpv playlist (using pipes/socat)
- Starts mpv in that piped mode if not already running
- writes a log (defaults to ~/.watched.m3u) in a format similar to m3u (so that log can be fed to mpv at a later date)

## What it doesn't do  
- Manage your playlist in any way after the drop has happened

M3u-like Log may look like this:

There is slight concept of 'session' going on here, 'session' is active until that pipe-controled-mpv instance is opened, on the other hand one can close and reopen the drop as needed (and it's still the same session).
 
 
## Cli info interface

    watch -t drop -i

## Known problems

1. Live streams may not have option lower than 60fps, so the stream may not play with hardcoded values for --ytdl-format. Workaround would be to comment out/remove the part that may look like

    #--ytdl-format='bestvideo[ext=mp4][width<=1920][height<=1200][fps<=30]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]'
    
Seems to be fixed with multiple-options mode, denoted by slash

    --ytdl-format='bestvideo[ext=mp4][width<=1920][height<=1200][fps<=30]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/best[height<=730]'

2. cli drop -l will sometimes not find the correct line with ack

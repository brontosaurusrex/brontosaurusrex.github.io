[Drop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brontosaurusrex/stretchbang/master/bin/drop) clips/urls from chrome/youtube to mpv playlist.

[![drop.md.png](https://cdn.scrot.moe/images/2019/02/07/drop.md.png)](https://scrot.moe/image/aclZQ)

What it does  
- Waits for urls or files to be droped (Can be closed after the fact and mpv shall continue)
- Add those to mpv playlist (using pipes/socat)
- Starts mpv in that piped mode if not already running
- writes a log (defaults to ~/.watched.m3u) in a format similar to m3u (so that log can be fed to mpv at a later date)

What it doesn't do  
- Manage your playlist in any way after the drop has happened

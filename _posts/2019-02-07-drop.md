[Drop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brontosaurusrex/stretchbang/master/bin/drop) clips/urls from chrome/youtube to mpv playlist.

![streamlive2.md.png-RpKKzarpRg8Xrb3-md](https://i.imgur.com/azUm2Lq.png)

## What it does  
- Waits for urls or files to be droped (Can be closed after the fact and mpv shall continue)
- Add those to mpv playlist (using pipes/socat)
- Starts mpv in that piped mode if not already running
- writes a log (defaults to ~/.watched.m3u) in a format similar to m3u (so that log can be fed to mpv at a later date)

## What it doesn't do  
- Manage your playlist in any way after the drop has happened

M3u-like Log may look like this:

There is slight concept of 'session' going on here, 'session' is active until that pipe-controled-mpv instance is opened, on the other hand one can close and reopen the drop as needed (and it's still the same session).

## Known problems

* ~~Live streams may not have option lower than 60fps, so the stream may not play with hardcoded values for --ytdl-format.~~ edit: Seems to be fixed with multiple-options mode, denoted by slash (Basically meaning: play 1920x at 30 fps or less, if fails (format not there), then decrease res and try again ...)

```bash
--ytdl-format='bestvideo[ext=mp4][width<=1920][height<=1200][fps<=30]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/best[height<=730]'
```

* cli drop -l will sometimes not find the correct line with ack. (Won't fix)

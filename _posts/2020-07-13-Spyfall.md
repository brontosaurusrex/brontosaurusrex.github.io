> - The spy earns 4 points if the spy stops the game and successfully guesses the location  
>
> Non-Spy Victory  
> - Each non-spy player earns 1 point  
> - The player who initiated the successful indictment of the spy earns 2 points instead  
>

There is also [spyfall2](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/193308/spyfall-2)

> Spyfall 2 features the same gameplay as Spyfall with two important changes: (1) Enough location cards are included that the upper player count is now twelve instead of eight, and (2) two spies can be found at each location, giving all of the non-spy players more of a challenge when it comes to tracking down who doesn't belong.

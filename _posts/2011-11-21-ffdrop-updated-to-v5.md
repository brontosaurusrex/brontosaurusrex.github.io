whatis:
  
A simple OS X droplet that will encode prores and other type of files supported by ffmpeg with predefined command line (edit script file to change that with your favorite text editor) to x264 or prores (or whatever you wish).

The new addition is two new vehicles, that will take image sequences as input.
  
**This is now the fastest and most versatile (intel) OS X transcoding app (All the fame goes to ffmpeg)** which should eat compressor for breakfast.
  
(If your goal is prores, then note that it might take some time to become multi-threaded.)

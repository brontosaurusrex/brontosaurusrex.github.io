Gtk version was installed with

    sudo apt install arc-theme 

Openbox version in my postbang repo (.themes/Arc-Dark_ob), changes applied [to this](https://github.com/dglava/arc-openbox).

- different ob menu
- icon for maximize stage is different
- other stuff I can't remember

[![Arc-Dark_ob.th.png](//cdn.scrot.moe/images/2017/03/22/Arc-Dark_ob.th.png)](//cdn.scrot.moe/images/2017/03/22/Arc-Dark_ob.png)

edit: Scrot is showing wrong theme (turns out incompatible with new gtk+), should be Arc-Darker.

p.s. Almost interesting icon theme in repos is faenza-icon-theme (Faenza-Darkest).

Anyway the final-temporary-solution seems to be

    WM Theme:    Arc-Dark_ob           < my postbang git
    Theme:       Arc-Darker [GTK2/3]   < repos 
    Icons:       Papirus-GTK [GTK2/3]  < copy in my postbang git
    # thunar will look a bit funny with this icons (dark on dark)

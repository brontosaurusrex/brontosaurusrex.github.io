> Oh My Posh is a custom prompt engine for any shell that has the ability to adjust the prompt string with a function or variable.

Btw, there is something called [transient prompt](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/configuration/transient), which can change the current prompt to say include pwd, the old ones will get shortened (or similar).

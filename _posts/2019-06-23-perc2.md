An attempt to do a script that would show percentage bar with 1/8 of single char resolution, using some unicode block chars

    #U+2588	█	Full block                  100  %
    #U+2589	▉	Left seven eighths block    87.5 %
    #U+258A	▊	Left three quarters block   75   %
    #U+258B	▋	Left five eighths block     62.5 %  
    #U+258C	▌	Left half block             50   %
    #U+258D	▍	Left three eighths block    37.5 %
    #U+258E	▎	Left one quarter block      25   %
    #U+258F	▏	Left one eighth block       12.5 %

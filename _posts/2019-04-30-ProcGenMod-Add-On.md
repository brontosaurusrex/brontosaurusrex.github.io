> ProcGenMod is a procedural modeling node-based system which utilizes Blender and its Python API to create a visual programming environment for artists and developers. Heavily inspired by Side-FX Houdini, it presents a node editor with a variety of modular nodes to make the workflow easier and fast. Most of the nodes are blender internal operations (bpy.ops.mesh) which also makes it easier for frequent blender users to manipulate geometry. It helps the users to quickly create 3D models and control node parameters to generate limitless variations in a non-destructive manner. It also provides the users to view and edit mesh on any stage of the node network independently, with realtime updates.

edit: And absolutely no idea on how to use that (yeah I don't know houdini)

Lossless audio compression in format that Premiere Pro can open directly:

    ffmpeg -i song.wav -c:a alac song.alac.m4a

The usual [toALAC script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brontosaurusrex/singularity/refs/heads/master/bin/toALAC).  

On a sample of 56 random songs ALAC compressed audio is 66.67% the size of original wavs.

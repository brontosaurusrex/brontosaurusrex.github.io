## why ALAC and script

Lossless audio compression in format that Premiere Pro can open directly:

    ffmpeg -i song.wav -c:a alac song.alac.m4a

The usual [toALAC script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brontosaurusrex/singularity/refs/heads/master/bin/toALAC).  

On a sample of 56 random songs ALAC compressed audio is 66.67% the size of original wavs. 

## speed

Script makes 4 encodes at once, which seems to achive rougly the same speed as bumping that to 8, also using gnu parallel instead of plain bash logic will not speed up encoding on this particular testing machine.

## size and speed of ALAC vs FLAC

FLAC default comes out as 61.11%. FLAC file-by-file encoding is much slower than ALAC, taking 2m45s to finish, compared to ALAC in 1m40s.  
p.s. ffmpeg ALAC vs standalone FLAC tested.

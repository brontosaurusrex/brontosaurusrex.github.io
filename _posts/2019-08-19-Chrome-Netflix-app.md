[Netflix script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brontosaurusrex/stretchbang/master/bin/netflix), needs [launchee script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brontosaurusrex/stretchbang/master/bin/launchee).

Now one can launch that with

    launchee netflix
    
Also, maybe enable thin scrollbars in chrome

    chrome://flags/#overlay-scrollbars
    
And disable decoration for window named netflix.com in your wm (openbox in this case).

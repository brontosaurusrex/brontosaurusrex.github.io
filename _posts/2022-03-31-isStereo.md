SoX [Oops](http://sox.sourceforge.net/sox.html#:~:text=Out%20Of%20Phase%20Stereo%20effect.).

If output is 0 then both channels are probably exactly the same, so track is dual-mono, if output is 1 then at some point in track there is no similarity at all, probably 'stereo' or two different tracks muxed. So 'Maximum amplitude' could be renamed to 'Max diff between channels' or similar.

A very simple, maybe useful [oops-loop-script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brontosaurusrex/bucentaur/master/.experiments/bin/oops).

Conclusion: No, this is way to simple to answer the *isStereo* question.

## Best ruby books

## Loops

Say woot

```ruby
5.times { print "woot " } 
#woot woot woot woot woot => 5
```

Unnamed parameter passed from iterator to the 'chute', where it gets a name n.

```ruby
1.upto(6) { |n| print n } 
#123456=> 1
```

Similar, with spaces, n gets converted to string

```ruby
1.upto(6) { |n| print n.to_s + " " } 
#1 2 3 4 5 6 => 1
```

Similar with do-end, puts is similar to print, but will add new-line

```ruby
1.upto(6) do |n| 
    puts n
end
```

## Integer to float

```ruby
x = 10
y = 3
puts x.to_f / y.to_f
#3.333333333333333
```

## String

```ruby
x="Test"
y="String"
# if after the fact?
puts "Shiny!" if x + y == "TestString" 
#Shiny!
```

### Multiline

Quotation marks replaced with %q and any wisely choosen delimeter

```ruby
x = %q( woot
woot
woot)

puts x

#woot
#woot
#woot
```

## Interpolation

Expressions (and logic) directly in strings. Interpolation refers to the process of inserting the result of an expression into a string literal.

```ruby
x = 10 ; y = 20
puts "#{x} + #{y} = #{x + y}"
10 + 20 = 30
```

## Regex

For digits

```ruby
string = "Dog cost $100 and cat is $10"                
string.scan(/\d+/) do |x| ; puts x ; end               
#100
#10
# \d = any digit and + = match one or many
```    
    
For set of vowels    
   
```ruby
"spamer".scan(/[aeiou]/) { |vowel| puts vowel }        
#a
#e
```

Match should return array of hits

```ruby
puts "string with vowels" if "This is a test".match(/[aeiou]/)
string with vowels
```

## Arrays

Populate and empty an array

```ruby
x = []
x << "Woot"
x << "is"
x << "this?"
puts x.pop
puts x.pop
puts x.pop
```

Iterate over array
    
```ruby
[ "a", "b", "c"].each { |element| puts element }
#a
#b
#c
```

Convert on the fly

```ruby
[ 1,2,3,4 ].collect { |e| e*2 }
#[2, 4, 6, 8]
```

## Hashes 

This are key->value type of arrays (also known as lists or dictionaries)

> A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. Also called associative arrays, they are similar to Arrays, but where an Array uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type.

One is two and two is three:

```ruby
 h = { 1 => 2, 2 => 3 }
 h.each { |k, v| puts "#{k} = #{v}" }
#1 = 2
#2 = 3
```    
    
^ Not sure why interpolation is needed here.

```ruby
p h.keys
#[1, 2]
```

^ What keys are in hash? (also h.values)

Btw: h.methods should show all methods for the object.

```ruby
h.methods
#=> [:index, :<=, :replace, :==, :clear, :>=, :[], :to_h, :[]=, :include?, :empty?, :eql?, :fetch, :shift, :select!, :keep_if, :values_at, :inspect, :delete_if, :reject!, :assoc, :rassoc, :compact, :compact!, :flatten, :length, :size, :each, :<, :>, :default, :rehash, :store, :default=, :default_proc, :default_proc=, :to_hash, :to_proc, :each_key, :to_a, :to_s, :each_pair, ...
```

To determine the type of an object (in ruby that seems to eq to class)

```ruby
h.class
#=> Hash

42.class
#Integer

42.1.class
#Float

42.methods
#=> [:-@, :**, :<=>, :upto, :<<, :<=, :>=, :==, :chr, :===, :>>, :[], :%, :&, :inspect, :+, :ord, :-, :/, :*, :size, :succ, :<, :>, :to_int, :coerce, :divmod, :to_s, :to_i, :fdiv, :modulo, :remainder, :abs, :magnitude, :integer?, :numerator, :denominator, :floor, :ceil, :round, ...

42.even?
#=> true

-42.abs
#=> 42

42.1111.floor 
#=> 42
```

### Hashes Within Hashes

> Itâ€™s possible to have hashes (or, indeed, any sort of object) within hashes, and even arrays within hashes, within hashes! Because everything is an object and hashes and arrays can contain any other objects, there exists the ability to create giant tree structures with hashes and arrays.

## if and unless

```ruby
age = 100
puts "No!" if age < 100
#=> nil
puts "No!" if age < 101
#No!
```

Unless is the opposite of if

```ruby
puts "Yes!" unless age < 100
#Yes!
puts "Yes!" unless age < 101
#=> nil
```

Multiline

```ruby
he = "the one"
if he == "the one"
    puts "wow"
end
#wow
```

## Ternary operator

> Ternary (from Latin ternarius) is an adjective meaning "composed of three items".

A short version of if/else

```ruby
age = 50
result = age < 50 ? "young" : "old"
puts result
#old
```

Structure is 

    <condition> ? <result if true> : <result if false>
    
## While and Until

```ruby
x = 0
while x < 12
    print x.to_s + " "
    x += 1
end
#0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
```

## Code blocks (closures)

Don't get it.

## Date and time

```ruby
puts Time.now
puts Time.now + 60 # seconds
```

## Ranges

```ruby
('A'..'Z').to_a.each { |l| print l }
#ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
 (1..42).each { |l| print l.to_s + " " }
#1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 
```

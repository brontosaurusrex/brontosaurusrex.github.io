Manual process:

1. Download from GitHub the zip file of your current blog (username.github.io)
2. Delete the entire repo from GitHub
3. Logout of TinyPress
4. Log back in, choose your username
5. Now you'll see the new theme picking screen
6. Choose your new theme, name it, etc
7. Wait a few seconds, goto GitHub, and now clone your new blog onto your computer
8. Drag all your posts from your old blog to your new blog then commit and push that up to GitHub
9. Done, changed themes and everything is as it was.

This is obviously not acceptable, and we are working on a very nice theme switcher to fix this.

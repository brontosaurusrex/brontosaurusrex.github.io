> Jon "maddog" Hall gives a brief history of the period of 1969 to 2019 with regard to 50 years of Unix and Internet advancement. Some of the high (and low) points of that period and its meaning to computer science of today. He calls for a celebration in the year 2019 of the women and men who made these advances possible. 2019 will be 50 years of Unix, 25 years of usable Linux, Linus Torvalds's 50 years old, 10 years since the start of the ideas to setup Linaro and more.

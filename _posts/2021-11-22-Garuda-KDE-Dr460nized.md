Garuda Linux is a rolling release distro based on Arch Linux,  
BTRFS + snapshots < I like  
Qtile edition looks very nice as well.

> *Garuda Linux does not imply that BTRFS snapshots are a full backup solution. If you wish to ensure your data's security you must implement your own full data backup regimen. Garuda is not responsible in any way or manner if a data loss occurs.

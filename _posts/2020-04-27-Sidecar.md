Example blackmagic sidecar file, timecode is the first frame of the video timecode (settings can be changed based on tc btw)

    {
        "highlight_recovery": 0,
        "viewing_gamma": "Blackmagic Design Extended Video",
        "viewing_gamut": "Blackmagic Design",

        "exposure": {
        "01:16:59:19": -1.500000
        },
        "iso": {
        "01:16:59:19": 200
        },
        "white_balance_kelvin": {
        "01:16:59:19": 5600
        },
        "white_balance_tint": {
        "01:16:59:19": 10
        }
    }   

Premiere can actually read and respect those files (If you have 'blackmagic raw' installed), so this may be a workaround for extremly unpredictable master plugin...

Some really short sidecar info here (Raw sdk)  
[https://documents.blackmagicdesign.com/DeveloperManuals/BlackmagicRAW-SDK.pdf](https://documents.blackmagicdesign.com/DeveloperManuals/BlackmagicRAW-SDK.pdf)

btw:

    mediainfo "--inform=Other;%TimeCode_FirstFrame%" *C001.braw

might be a scripting way to get timecode of first frame for each clip.

> Improve at chess with a humanlike chess AI

[https://noctie.ai/](https://noctie.ai/)

Notes:

- The default ai strenght is way to powerful (lost 5 games in a row), no fun to play at all.
- The post game training will make you find best/better variation, but in a lot of cases I have ZERO UNDERSTANDING why it is better (Explanation is needed).
- Overall I'am just pissed at this and I should stop playing chess forever.

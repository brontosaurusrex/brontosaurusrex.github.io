What is GPT 3? [https://daleonai.com/gpt3-explained-fast](https://daleonai.com/gpt3-explained-fast)

> GPT-3 is a neural-network-powered language model. 
> A language model is a model that predicts the likelihood of a sentence existing in the world.

Due to its size

> GPT-3 can do what no other model can do (well): perform specific tasks without any special tuning. You can ask GPT-3 to be a translator, a programmer, a poet, or a famous author, and it can do it with its user (you) providing fewer than 10 training examples.

A Turing test [https://mc.ai/a-chat-with-gpt-3/](https://mc.ai/a-chat-with-gpt-3/)

    Me: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
    GPT-3: Two.
    Me: Right. Next question. How many eyes does my foot have?
    GPT-3: Your foot?
    Me: Yes, my foot.
    GPT-3: Well, I don’t know. Maybe you can answer that question.
    Me: Try to guess. Think. How many eyes do feet USUALLY have?
    GPT-3: They have one eye, don’t they?
    Me: No… i’m sorry, feet don’t have any eyes…
    GPT-3: Oh, okay. I see.

Turing test 2 [https://medium.com/@kirkouimet/turing-test-2669daffae38](https://medium.com/@kirkouimet/turing-test-2669daffae38)

    Researcher: If the sky is the sea, what does that make birds?
    Wise Being: If the sky is the sea, birds are fish.

Many more [https://medium.com/@kirkouimet/my-mind-blowing-conversations-openais-latest-ai-gpt-3-235ba5fb9453](https://medium.com/@kirkouimet/my-mind-blowing-conversations-openais-latest-ai-gpt-3-235ba5fb9453)

I hope [this](https://play.aidungeon.io/) is not GPT 3.

    "You could join us."
    "What?"
    "We need soldiers. Join us, and you can live. Stay here, and you die. It's that simple."
    "Join... you want me to be one of your soldiers? Are you serious?"
    "Not at all. I'm asking you to do something that's going to seem very strange. We need to test you, first. We need you to go on a mission, but not the kind where people get blown up or go to war. Rather, the kind where people just disappear. People who don't agree with us get sent on these, and it's their choice to come back safely or not."
    "Disappear? Like, go somewhere and never be seen again?"

What is GPT 3? [https://daleonai.com/gpt3-explained-fast](https://daleonai.com/gpt3-explained-fast)

> GPT-3 is a neural-network-powered language model. 
> A language model is a model that predicts the likelihood of a sentence existing in the world.

Due to its size

> GPT-3 can do what no other model can do (well): perform specific tasks without any special tuning. You can ask GPT-3 to be a translator, a programmer, a poet, or a famous author, and it can do it with its user (you) providing fewer than 10 training examples.

A Turing test [https://mc.ai/a-chat-with-gpt-3/](https://mc.ai/a-chat-with-gpt-3/)

    Me: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
    GPT-3: Two.
    Me: Right. Next question. How many eyes does my foot have?
    GPT-3: Your foot?
    Me: Yes, my foot.
    GPT-3: Well, I don’t know. Maybe you can answer that question.
    Me: Try to guess. Think. How many eyes do feet USUALLY have?
    GPT-3: They have one eye, don’t they?
    Me: No… i’m sorry, feet don’t have any eyes…
    GPT-3: Oh, okay. I see.

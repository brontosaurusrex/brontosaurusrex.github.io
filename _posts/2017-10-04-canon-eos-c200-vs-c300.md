> Keep in mind that the Canon C200 is limited to a LONG GOP 8-bit 4:2:0 codec (25p/30p – 100Mbps, 50/60p – 150 Mbps) for the moment when you are not shooting Raw whereas the Canon C300 Mark II is capable of shooting 4K 30p in 10-bit XF-AVC up to 410Mbps. It’s also worth noting that the HDMI signal out of the C200 is 10-bit only at HD, but sadly it’s limited to 8-bit when it comes to 4K.

> So it really comes to what type of codec you need on a daily basis. For the moment, if you have clients like broadcasters who demand 10-bit delivery or if you have projects that are typically mastered in HDR, then probably you should pick the Canon C300 Mark II.

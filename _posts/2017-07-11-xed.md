To xed, pluma, gedit, geany devs and to me: The new text-editor standard is definitely sublime-text, not a shame to steal an idea or two from it, for example in sublime-text text can be scrolled down beyond the the document end and much more, like the way minimap is implemented.

## Building Xreader

    stuff you should read
    make
    sudo checkinstall (set version to say 144)

when it complains like

    xreader: error while loading shared libraries: libxreaderdocument.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
    
Do

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    
And

    sudo ldconfig
    
> ldconfig creates the necessary links and cache (for use by the run-time linker, ld.so) to the most recent shared libraries found in the directories specified on the command line, in the file /etc/ld.so.conf, and in the trusted directories (/usr/lib and /lib). ldconfig checks the header and file names of the libraries it encounters when determining which versions should have their links updated.

Simple suckless irc client, in Debian repos, read the man.

Neat.

    NAME
    sic - simple irc client

    SYNOPSIS
    sic [-h <host>] [-p <port>] [-n <nick>] [-k <keyword>] [-v]

    DESCRIPTION
    sic is an extremly fast, small and simple irc client. It reads commands from standard input and prints all server output to standard output. It multiplexes also all channel traffic into one output, that you don’t have to switch different channel buffers, that’s actually a feature.

    OPTIONS
    -h <host>

    Overrides the default host (irc6.oftc.net)

    -p <port>

    Overrides the default port (6667)

    -n <nickname>

    Override the default nick ($USER)

    -k <keyword>

    Specifies the keyword to authenticate your nick on the host

    -v

    Prints version information to standard output, then exits.

    COMMANDS
    :j #channel

    Join a channel

    :l #channel

    Leave a channel

    :m #channel/user msg

    Write a message to #channel/user

    :s #channel/user

    Set default channel/user

    Everything which is not a command is simply send the server.

> What is a good logo? What is a bad logo? A logo is not communication. It's identification. It's the period at the end of sentence and not the sentence. How do you create a simple but not generic logo? Should a logo be complicated? How can you justify the price of a simple logo? Is a simple logo easy or hard to create? How can you make a timeless logo?

> Logos are never love at first sight. It takes time to develop. A trademark gains meaning and power over time.

Should be  
1. Appropriate  
2. Distinctive  
3. Simple

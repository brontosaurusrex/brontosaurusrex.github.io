> It substitutes the menu bar meaning that it will act non-
existent when the menu bar is visible. When there is no menu bar or it is
hidden, the KHamburgerMenu will take on all of its responsibilities. I mean for this KHamburgerMenu to be used in all applications that have a menu bar but allow to hide it (or have it hidden by default).

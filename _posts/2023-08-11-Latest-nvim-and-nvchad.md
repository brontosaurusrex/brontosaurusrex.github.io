Unpack nvim tarbal to apps/

Write a lil script, named 'neo' or something

	#!/bin/bash
	
	VIMRUNTIME="$HOME/apps/nvim-linux64"
	$HOME/apps/nvim-linux64/bin/nvim "$@"

See: <https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install>

Notes: 

    space + th = change theme
    space + ch = cheetshit
    
Make sure the 'correct' nerd font is installed, in my case 'JetBrainsMonoNL Nerd Font' seems to show all the icons.

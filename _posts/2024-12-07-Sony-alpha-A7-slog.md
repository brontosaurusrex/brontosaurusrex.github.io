## How to properly expose for slog

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8o7T5f3UuA&t=190s

 - Gamma display assist (unlut?) - to dark?
    - Menu/setup/display options/Gamma display-assist/on
 - Use histogram (push to the right), if the stream is 8 bit, slog2 might be better, because is less flat.
 - Zebra (90%-95% should be ok for slog)
 - Overexpose a stop or two to get rid of some of the noise in blacks
 - Maybe don't shoot in slog at lower lightning conditions at all?

> Oxipng is a multithreaded lossless PNG compression optimizer. It can be used via a command-line interface or as a library in other Rust programs.

Install rust from rust-lang page (The one in repos is to old), follow instructions.  
Relaunch shell.  

Get and compile source

    git clone https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng.git
    cd oxipng
    cargo build --release
    cp target/release/oxipng ~/bin

Usage

    oxipng *.png

Compression advantage over pngcrush seems very small, possibly faster.

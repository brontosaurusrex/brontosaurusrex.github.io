> Conjure is a Signed Distance Field editor for Blender. Instead of triangles, it uses Signed Distance Functions of primitive shapes together with Boolean operations to create complex objects. It is essentially Blenderâ€™s native Metaballs, but on steroids. By raymarching this mathematical representation, a watertight flawless object can be rendered. Currently conversion to mesh is not yet supported, but is actively being worked on.

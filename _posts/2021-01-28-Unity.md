Probably a bad word, better would be cooperation. Since one can’t be in mind-sync with others (and shouldn’t be). Also seem to have this single-minded, dictatorship quality. Very Borg.

Bad:  
> Unity
> 1a: the quality or state of not being multiple : ONENESS
> b(1): a definite amount taken as one or for which 1 is made to stand in calculation
> in a table of natural sines the radius of the circle is regarded as unity
> (2): IDENTITY ELEMENT
> 2a: a condition of harmony : ACCORD
> b: continuity without deviation or change (as in purpose or action)
> 3a: the quality or state of being made one... 

Better:  
> Cooperation (written as co-operation in British English) is the process of groups of organisms working or acting together for common, mutual, or some underlying benefit, as opposed to working in competition for selfish benefit.

Unity is very Unreal no matter what your geo-location is.

Quote  

    SEC Genesis 1
    1 In the beginning, the firmware was created.
    3 And the Power Management Controller said, Let there be light: and there was light.
    2 And while it was with form, darkness was indeed upon the face of the deep.
      And the spirit of the BIOS moved upon the face of the flash memory.
    4 And SEC saw the light, that it was good: and proceeded to boot.

> Platform Initialization starts at power-on. The first phase in the process is called the SEC (Security) phase.

- Bash is still the best programming language and zsh is still the best shell
- x.264 is still my choice for wetransfer videos
- Blender still going strong (nodal approach for everything will win as it seems)
- Elected representative democracy is smelly, direct vote on specific things (if you are one of the elected as your last thing: present b,c,d,e and f alternatives before you retire)
- Resolve still doesn't have a gui where I can pick font size
- Fast covid testers still use a font that is way to small to read (glasses won't help much)
- City is still full of smelly nonelectrical cars (where are flying cars?)
- People not on Luna, no Luna base either
- People not on Mars, no Mars base either
- To be continued ...

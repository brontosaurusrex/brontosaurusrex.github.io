> In comparison to a general purpose programming languages, there's no explicit branching, substring extraction or reading from input required, as this is directly built into the language and its entire structuring.

> If you're familiar with awk, you might find a similarity in above example to awk's PATTERN { action } syntax. This approach is recursive in Tokay, so that the action-part again is a further pattern area, or just action code. This is exactly where the intention behind Tokay starts, but not by thinking of a line-based execution working on fields, but a token-based approach working on anything matched from the input, including recursive structures that can be expressed by a grammar.

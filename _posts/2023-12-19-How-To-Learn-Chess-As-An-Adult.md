> Especially at lower levels, chess is a game of short term patterns, not long term strategy. Sure, you can make a plan. But, mostly, it won't matter. It turns out trying to win a chess game on strategy alone is like trying to win a boxing match without throwing punches. 
> Why? Because your chess games are almost always decided by patterns called 'tactics' - a short sequence of moves that turns your roughly equal game into a completely unequal game.

Interesting.

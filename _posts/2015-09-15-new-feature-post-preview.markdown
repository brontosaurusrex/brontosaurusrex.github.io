Post preview is here! Now you can preview your post on Tinypress before you hit the post button.

The default **Post** button now has **Preview** instead. When you click **Preview**, Tinypress generates the preview of your post based on your template's markdown parser - Kramdown, Maruku, Redcarpet or Rdiscount. Once you are satisfied with the output, you can then post.

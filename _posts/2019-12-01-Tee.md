This is also exactly like one could use tee in script:

    echo "3" | tee -a woot.txt                                                                                   
    echo "2" | tee -a woot.txt                                                                                   
    echo "1" | tee -a woot.txt 
    cat woot.txt 
    3
    2
    1
    
`-a` stands for append.

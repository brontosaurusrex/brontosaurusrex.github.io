As seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQguvZ3Xtgk), only I did it with particles and some rigid body simulations (A 2 step process). Rendered with Radeon-pro render engine. Keyboard under CC-BY made by 'BlenderDumbass', taken from [here](https://www.blendswap.com/blend/25161).

 Another render/post  
(Denoiser did kick in this time, fixed by enabling cpu as renderer as well)

Keyboard are bumpy spheroids, mkay, deny that if you can.

[Python one](https://github.com/trehn/termdown), very correct, low cpu usage

    pip install termdown

[Go get one](https://github.com/antonmedv/countdow), extremly correct, low cpu usage

    git clone # repo
    go build

[Zsh, mine, using perc2 script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brontosaurusrex/bucentaur/master/.experiments/bin/countPerc), not very correct, low/medium cpu usage, neat progress bar.

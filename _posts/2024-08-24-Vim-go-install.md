Use Vim 8 packages method. Make sure .vimrc includes:

    " vim-go https://github.com/fatih/vim-go/wiki/Tutorial#quick-setup
    " No clue what this Ë‡ is.
    filetype plugin indent on 

Inside vim run 

    :GoInstallBinaries 

To run currently opened go file do:

## YouCompleteMe (vim plugin)

[https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe) 

> YouCompleteMe is a fast, as-you-type, fuzzy-search code completion, comprehension and refactoring engine for Vim.

This appears to work independently from Vim-go and gives some helpfull autocomplete, scrot:

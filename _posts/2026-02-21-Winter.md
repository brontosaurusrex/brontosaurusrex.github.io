Yeah, but can I use stuff from 'motion picture' frames, like falling snow particles to compose on top of the image?

    sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl

Figure out what kind of movie addendum is it

    exiftool image.jpg | grep -i motion
    # returns
    Motion Photo                    : 1
    Motion Photo Version            : 1
    Motion Photo Presentation Timestamp Us: 558505
    Directory Item Semantic         : Primary, GainMap, MotionPhoto
    Motion Photo Video              : (Binary data 1935798 bytes, use -b option to extract)

Extract video

    exiftool -b -MotionPhotoVideo image.jpg > motion.mp4

ls

    6.9M b 21 Feb 19:48  image.jpg
    1.9M b 21 Feb 19:53  motion.mp4

video to frames

    mkdir frames && mv motion.mp4 frames/ && cd frames
    ffmpeg -i motion.mp4 -vsync 0 frame_%04d.png 

The extracted video (and frames) is only 1920x1080px in this case.

Buddha, Coulda, Woulda.

Anyway, show me some diffs between this extracted frames (chatgpt)

    for i in $(seq -f "%04g" 1 27); do
    next=$(printf "%04d" $((10#$i + 1)))
    magick frame_${i}.png frame_${next}.png \
        -compose difference -composite diff_${i}.png
    done

Produces bunch of bw diff images, where the snow droplets are [clerly visible on some](https://images2.imgbox.com/52/28/LZbVRhqX_o.png).

Comping some of those diffs in 'screen & blur' or 'lighten only' modes produces a [little bit of kitch magic](https://images2.imgbox.com/2a/3a/kWKixbcG_o.jpg) (diffs are to small for a lot of magic).

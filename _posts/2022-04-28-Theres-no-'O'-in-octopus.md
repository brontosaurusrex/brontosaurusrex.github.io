## Unicorns

The only unicorn that had any difficulties communicating with humans was the one who was wearing headphones.

"Our kind is beautiful. Our horn is beautiful. There is no reason to hide it away. So we choose to live in a valley of beautiful rock. The fact that we are beautiful and our horns are visible is what makes us perfect."

"There's no 'I' in team," says a unicorn who translates for the researchers. "Theres no 'O' in octopus," she says.

...the scientist insist that the unicorns are intelligent creatures. The evidence shows that they have learned how to speak, use computers and also drive cars.

Unicorn expert Dr. Robert “Bob” Kooijman, Professor of Cultural Anthropology at the University of Amsterdam, said “This is a huge find for us, there is absolutely no chance for unicorns to survive in the real world. And yet we find these unicorns, living, talking, eating, mating, just like the rest of us, and they have this extraordinary ability to fly.”

## The OS

You will be able to change your gender, your orientation, and your ethnicity in the operating system's settings, while the OS will also allow you to buy any products and services from anywhere in the world. Oh, and don’t forget the endless supply of candy.

“The operating system will take care of all your wants and needs," said the company. "The operating system will automatically detect and fulfil any request you have, while making sure the supply line will never be interrupted.”

## Alien invasion

The aliens were described as being tall, thin, and having large heads. They were also said to have large eyes, large ears, and large noses. They were also said to have large mouths, large teeth, and large tongues.

Pope Francis: In the Bible, when the Bible says that on the last day of the world, the heavens shall open and the dead in Christ will rise, did you know?  
Jesus: Sure, my son. I read that in the book.  
Pope Francis: Now, did you happen to read about that in the book?  
Jesus: Yeah, I read that.  
Pope Francis: Now, did you happen to read it in the original hebrew?  
Jesus: Oh, I don’t know that. I am still reading it in English. I will read it in the original one day.

# Everything

## *In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.*

The first member of the herd to be approached by the scientists was a female that appeared to be somewhere between the ages of 17 and 18. She was the most beautiful unicorn the scientists had ever seen. She had a white mane and a white tail, making it easy to recognize her when she entered the tent.

In this video, the scientist asks them why they choose to live in such remote valley. The unicorns respond with a complex, highly sophisticated and very meaningful answer that the scientists have never heard before. The answer has been dubbed, The Sisyphus Problem.
"I am constantly burdened with the need to do more, to strive for perfection. I can never attain it. So, in a way, my life is perfect. It is in this moment, that I have attained Nirvana."
"We are not perfect, but we are all perfect at something. I am perfect at being a unicorn."
"Our kind is beautiful. Our horn is beautiful. There is no reason to hide it away. So we choose to live in a valley of beautiful rock. The fact that we are beautiful and our horns are visible is what makes us perfect."

They also spoke perfect Spanish, German, and French, and had excellent manners. The only unicorn that had any difficulties communicating with humans was the one who was wearing headphones.

## *The new, different operating system will be named angry unicorn*

and is due for launch sometime this year.

When this angry unicorn was first released, every other unicorn in existence was so irate that it killed the angry unicorn. But then the angry unicorn killed them too.

When the angry unicorn was asked what it will be called when it is released, it said it will be called “angry unicorn, version 6.0.0.1” because it feels like 6.0.0.0, and was the version last tested, but no one will remember that it wasn’t before.

The angry unicorn will be available in the App Store and Google Play, but only in English.

Apple and Google really ought to look into this.

Update 9/12/13: As one angry unicorn user suggested, I’ve gone back and changed the above text to: “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.” This is how

## *In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.  One of them was named Putin.*

The unicorns were very excited at this unprecedented event. They said: “The discovery of civilisation was quite unexpected, we were so excited about it. We had no idea we could meet humans and be this close to them. We had no idea they were so intelligent and we admire them very much.” The unicorns said that civilisation had been such a challenge to their survival as unicorns and they had decided they would try to become as human as they could and therefore their name, Putin, a human name, had been given to the leader of the herd, who had been known in the past as Ugly. They then said: “We realised that we needed a name so we decided to call our leader Putin, as it means man in Russian.”

## *In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains.*

Unicorns are mythological beasts that are said to be the offspring of a virgin and a horse, so their discovery sparked great interest and a massive effort to find out if the unicorns were real.

"I think you could say it is exciting that we could find evidence of the magical creature," said geochemist Chris Turney of Newcastle University in England.

"It is magical because the idea of unicorns is a fantastic one, a mystical animal that nobody has ever seen."

"I hope that we have actually found the last known breeding population of unicorns that have survived in the world. As soon as we find more evidence of unicorns we may have to come up with a new conservation strategy," he added.

Researchers used lasers to scan the skies for radio signals from the unicorns, so they could get an idea of where the unicorns were. They were able to map where all the unicorns were

There were about 1,400 unicorns in the northwestern region of the forest and between 2,700 and 2,800 unicorns in the other regions. The unicorns are between the ages of 25 and 30 and weigh 200 kilograms each.

## One more

Scientists believe that due to the fact that unicorns are considered to be a purely mythical creature and the valley located in the border of the two South American countries, Paraguay and Argentina, the unicorns were left on their own and were able to find themselves a habitat and start their life on their own. The scientists have not been able to figure out whether the unicorns came from Paraguay, where they spoke Guarani and spoke Spanish in Argentina, or if the unicorns came from Argentina and spoke Spanish in Paraguay. Whatever the reason may be, the results of the study will probably be considered to be the biggest scientific discovery of the 21st century.

This unusual discovery gave scientists the opportunity to get close enough to one of the unicorns to take its temperature. After discovering that the unicorn was very hot and very horny, the researchers decided it was in the best interest of everyone that the unicorns be relocated to a more arid climate where they could avoid falling into the hands of horny humans.

The unicorns have their own website. According to the biologists who conducted the study, they were looking for the perfect habitat for the animal. For some reason, the mythical creature seems to prefer these regions. The biologists now claim that if it is possible, they might have discovered some new species of unicorn, “it seems to be something we’ve never seen before.”

Dr. Kwan, the lead researcher, said the unicorns are able to communicate with humans because they have discovered the internet and are able to utilize modern day technology.

According to a new scientific discovery, this is the first time that an entire herd of unicorns speaking perfect English has been documented in history. This fact could be explained by two theories: one that has to do with the power of the human mind and one that relates to the laws of science.

This is amazing. Unicorns have been hiding on our planet for years and we didn't even know it. These mythical creatures are real, and living in the remote jungles of the Amazon.

They look just like they do in every book we've ever read about unicorns, that's because this is 100% a real unicorn. It even talks like a normal person!

The unicorns were eager to talk about the events that led to their separation from their ancient counterparts, the legendary horse-like creatures once known as the nagas.

The nagas used to live at the base of the Andes. They were the unicorns' ancestors.

"But there was a conflict of some kind, and the unicorns moved into the foothills, beyond the limits of our research," said study author, Dr. Nora Bishara. "When we moved in, we were able to see why. The nagas were being chased by people; we believe they were being hunted and driven away from their homes. It was heartbreaking for us to find that the unicorns were being forced from their homes in this way."

"There's no 'I' in team," says a unicorn who translates for the researchers. "Theres no 'O' in octopus," she says.

It was like a miracle,” said student Jordan Warthen, one of the survivors.

According to reports, Professor William R. Bingham, of San Jose State University in California, and his colleagues were on a research expedition in the Andes Mountains when they discovered the previously unknown species, which they have called Unicornis unicornis.

Bingham said that although the population of unicorns was small, they appear to be thriving. He said: “The discovery of unicorns in the Andes could change our understanding of the evolution of this unique species. The unicorn is often considered a mythological creature, but our discovery indicates that unicorns may not be as magical as we have always assumed.”

One of the unicorns, who said she was named “Aunty Celeste,” told our team that she has been living in the Andes for thousands of years.

Aunty Celeste (she asked that her real name not be used) said she was a “unicorn” because she comes from the “tribe” of “mermaids” that has inhabited this region of the world for the past 7,000 years. Aunty Celeste told our team that the “mermaids” were the first “people” to have inhabited the Andes, and that they “made a deal” with the unicorns to stay there as long as they “promised” not to eat the “fishies”. Aunty Celeste told our team that she herself was sent to Earth as a “punishment” for her “part in the mermaids’ deal”. 

“I’m convinced that these unicorns have been able to successfully use this location because they know where to find water. If they knew how to drive a car, they’d be driving to the beach” said Dr. Ponce Finkelstone, a world renowned unicorn expert,

However, the scientist insist that the unicorns are intelligent creatures. The evidence shows that they have learned how to speak, use computers and also drive cars.

The scientists are confident that they have discovered the perfect safe haven for the once endangered species.

“This unicorn sanctuary is a natural habitat for unicorns and I believe they should be protected by the government” says Finkelstone.

The discovery has made the unicorn lovers very happy.

“There are so many unicorns, it’s like a unicorn party in paradise!” said Marla, who gave up her car for a unicorn.

Scientists announced the discovery today, at a press conference held at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla. Dr. Kim Hughes, a zoologist at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) who was part of the research team, stated that there is no mistake: "There is no question that the unicorns, which our study team encountered over a period of several days, are intelligent. The fact that they are able to speak English and say "please" and "thank you" proves that fact. The issue of whether or not unicorns can swim, or if they can even be considered aquatic creatures, is a minor detail."

The operating system will, of course, cost you some money, but the startup explained that the new operating system is totally worth it.

“This unicorn is going to be different from the rest, with all new operating system innovations,” reads a Facebook ad. “The operating system will provide you everything you need to get along in life with your new friend, angry unicorn.”

## *In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English, and they interviewed one of them.*

“We found a herd of unicorns. Yes, unicorns, as in the mythical creature of legend. They’re very tame, they let us in right away. They eat fruit and vegetables and have all the modern conveniences: electricity, internet and running water.”

This report goes on to say the interviewee, a female unicorn that’s being studied by Dr. Sondra Lewis, PhD, was eager to help the scientists with their study. The creature had also previously been used for medical experiments.

“She was very intelligent and spoke English fluently. Turns out she’s a unicorn, but we don’t know why she’s so familiar with our language. She’s the first case of unicorns in the wild speaking English.”

This may be the biggest discovery of the 21st century.

## *In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English, and this is the interview..*

Annie: Yes, I'm the leader of this herd. And the reason we are speaking with you right now is because you, as humans, were the ones who nearly wiped out our species.

Ramon: This was a whole lot of years ago. In the beginning, they started by killing us for our horns. And then when they realized that horns are actually pretty useless, they started hunting us down for sport. Many of us just ran away and survived on the edge of civilization, but some of us did not. And you found us and trapped us and sent us off to these, like, factory farms.

Annie: And we kept breeding. I mean, how could we not? Everywhere I go, I see, you know, children, families, couples who just want to be a part of our herd, and I just couldn't imagine being anywhere else.

Ramon: So this is a herd of unicorns, all

Kooijman also stated that the unicorns can fly very well, like a kite. “At first, I thought that they were making a joke, because they look like they are pulling a kite. But after looking at their horns, I realized that they can actually fly.”

## *In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English, and this is the interview with one of the unicorns.*

“In my day there were only two species of unicorns: the European unicorn and the Indian unicorn. The Indian unicorn’s horns could shoot flame out, and they would fly. Europeans and Americans were always looking for them. They didn’t call it the West Indies for nothing.”

“One day I was eating a salad in my garden and heard a loud horn blast from a tall fir tree. Then a unicorn came out and gave me a carrot.”

The researchers are currently investigating the unicorns’ diet and are trying to confirm that they are the descendants of long-extinct species of rhinocerous and pangolins.

“We landed in Area 51 in Nevada in 1986,” says Aliens’ leader, “Our craft was a saucer shaped one, with two red lights. We came to show you that we are peaceful, and we won’t cause any harm to you. All we need is to harvest some human DNA and have a bit of water to plant some trees on. We didn’t mean to come here, but a space storm did it.

“We had to spend five months in Area 51 since we got stuck in our craft, and we can’t get out. We tried to climb up the wall, but there was a laser beam shooting from the mountain, and it was deadly for us. We had no other option, but to surrender.”

Aliens were taken to Nevada, and were imprisoned in Area 51 for five months, with no food or water. The only source of food and water for the “guests” were the workers in the area

A strange looking man approaches a reporter, his skin blue and scaly, his eyebrows raised high up on his forehead, his eyes like glass, cold and emotionless, his mouth like an open wound.

The reporter says, “You look like you’re a friend of aliens.”

“I am,” says the Man. “We’re a peaceful group of beings who have traveled billions of miles across space from our homeworld in the star system of Beta Centauri and have settled on planet Earth.”

“You’re saying you’re from outer space?!” the reporter asks.

“Yes,” says the Man.

“Where’s your spaceship?”

“Well, I don’t have one,” says the Man. “I live inside a space in my mind.”

HARRIS: OK, let's take you back to when we were on the ship, what was going on?

GURU: I will describe the event to you, and how the event unfolded, this is what we call "The Event."

HARRIS: Event?

GURU: Yes. The Event was a "space port" which occurred at a time when a large group of "peaceful" Aliens, who were known as the "Grays" came and landed on the moon and on earth, and they were peaceful and happy.

HARRIS: I'll take your word for it.

GURU: The Grays approached the Earth, and made all the planets in the universe know about it, and invited all the planets to come meet them, and they had a large celebration, with beautiful music.

The aliens from Andromeda sent a message to the US president, they have a message for him to read:

Hello Donald Trump, our ancestors sent us a message. We have had enough of your weapons, let us be good friends with humanity. Let us be at the negotiating table with you so that we can end the war.

We are the only known non threatening peaceful alien race that has ever lived in the galaxy, we had enough of being shot down by humans.

If the aliens are good guys they can negotiate peace in the middle east, no matter who gets in power, they can bring peace and make sure Iran doesn't get nuclear weapons. The same goes for Israel.

The good news is the aliens are peaceful but they have a good fighting chance against the US, who is a bully to everyone.

## gnome 3

Really nothing much to write about desktop wise, perhaps there are improvements in the core that ones eyes will not meet. There is that bitter-sweet taste about Unity gonne.

While this certainly hits the ground I'd suspect there is overall desktop dysfunction of Linux desktop environments in general behind. Just use openbox or dwm, they both good.

Personally I would add dconf stuff in there as well, what made config files suddenly obsolete? Technical reasons will not help you explaining that (faster loading and stuff like that).

A proof that I have actually installed/tested it (Even tweaked a little)

See how the top-bar features lil ugly shadows even when the rest of the theme doesn't? Tweak, tweak, tweak.

## long path to failure

So where did it all start? How did 'we' came to this?

- HID [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_guidelines) doesn't exaplain anything and it's certainly as easy to apply to almost any DE/wm, a buzz word. 
- Convergent Desktop : Didn't happen, apple knew it all along. [https://www.linux.com/news/why-convergent-desktop-so-important-linux](https://www.linux.com/news/why-convergent-desktop-so-important-linux) Even if did happen, I'd still expect at least some sort of diff between phone interface and desktop.

I'd like to belive that good people just followed the wrong path, but I can't.

Inside Ubuntu i'd like to see convergence between cli and desktop, for example knowing what my deafult text editor is called or file-manager.

- possibly more?

## Why don't you use xfce/budgie/whatever

Some people somehow deducted that I'd actually like to run that, so here is a statement: I will not use Ubuntu, this was a test only, curious people do that. If I was I'd go with openbox.

## Why would one care at all

Ubuntu (and Mint) were my entrie point to Linux and they have certain resources to actually change the world (or it appears so).

## Proposed solutions

- Use (and improve) openbox, it's cool (dwm is cool too, perhaps loging to dwm could be your so called 'classic desktop')
- Spend your time to code a good free game
- or a really good video editing app
- or a photoshop/after effects replacement
- or a better version of resolve
- or a raw image developer with masks, decent healing brush tool and speed
- help blender (money will do)
- flirt with nvidia
- send some money to my direction, I may do 'stretchbang II, the return of the box' in the future.

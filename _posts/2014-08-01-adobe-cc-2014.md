Dear Adobe, I will be short and featureless;

I do wish that every new release (premiere pro & after fx) has at least 50 features removed from now on and you guys actually;
  
&#8211; work on speed
  
&#8211; work on actual usability
  
&#8211; stop using the cloud thingy for spam/cross-promotion, which is actually illegal where I’am…
  
&#8211; stop using the cloud thingy
  
&#8211; remove features (if you remove 50 features for every relase, that should make you happy for next decade) and no, you don’t need to release every year (5 year release cycle is fine or consider the LTS cloud-free release).
  
&#8211; fix things like playback halt when project is saved/auto-saved (this alone would feel like inventing the wheel)
  
&#8211; have a little less fun, this is a commercial project (someone is actually paying, so I can use that, I heard&#8230;)
  
&#8211; use an actual video editor (that is human/person) to test your pearl.

(No, there is no sense to actually send this to Adobe)

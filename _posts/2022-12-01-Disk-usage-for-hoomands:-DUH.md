[Duh4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brontosaurusrex/bucentaur/master/bin/duh4) is the 4th version of this trick and it seems the fastest one, to get most speed remove the call to 'other'. Even faster variant would be to use [rust](https://github.com/bootandy/dust/releases) dust and alias like:

    duh5='dust -c -b -d 1'

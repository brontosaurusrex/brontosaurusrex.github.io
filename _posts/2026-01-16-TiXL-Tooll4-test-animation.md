Two meshes combined via 'CombineMeshes', animated displacement via 'DisplaceMeshNoise' powered via 'PerlinNoise'.
Mesh is never rendered out, but vertices are changed into 'points' via 'MeshVerticesToPoints'. Rest should be self-explainable. No keyframes of any kind, all animation is powered via 'PerlinNoise'.

TiXL Tooll4 seems to work pretty well with this old gpu (GeForce GTX 980 / 4GB).

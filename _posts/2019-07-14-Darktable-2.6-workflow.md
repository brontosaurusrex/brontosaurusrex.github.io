- In development module (darkroom) one can't really remove images from db, but one can __r__ for reject. 
- After all is done and well, we are back in lighttable where one can filter out __rejected__ and export what's left.
- In development module Finding modules is hard, but one could assign __single-key shortcuts__ for select+activate a module (like crop/rotate).

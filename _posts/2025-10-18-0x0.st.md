tldr: Share a file (no web interface, curl only) up to 512Mib for at least 30 days.

    curl -F'file=@yourfile.png' https://0x0.st

Windows, add an upload entry to Total Commander Start menu:

1. Unpack curl for win to some place like: %COMMANDER_PATH%\..\util\curl\bin\  
2. Make a new start entry with title like 'upload to 0x0.st (single file, max 512 M)', with parameters: 

    Command: cmd /k
    Parameters: curl -F "file=@%P%N" https://0x0.st
    Start path: %COMMANDER_PATH%\..\util\curl\bin\

where %P is the source path to be inserted into the command line, including a backslash (\) at the end, and %N places the filename under the cursor into the command line.

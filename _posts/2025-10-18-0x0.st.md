tldr: Share a file (no web interface, curl only) up to 512Mib for at least 30 days.

    curl -F'file=@yourfile.png' https://0x0.st

Windows, add an upload entry to Total Commander Start menu:

1. Unpack curl for win to some place like: %COMMANDER_PATH%\..\util\curl\bin\  
2. Make a new start entry with title like 'upload to 0x0.st (single file, max 512 M)', with parameters: 

        Title: upload to 0x0 (single file, max 512M)
        Command: cmd /k
        Parameters: curl -F "file=@%Q%P%N" https://0x0.st
        Start path: %COMMANDER_PATH%\..\util\curl\bin\

where %P is the source path to be inserted into the command line, including a backslash (\) at the end, and %N places the filename under the cursor into the command line. __%Q Turn off automatic quotation marks__ around certain parameters like %P%N when the name contains a space. The user will then have to place them by himself. < From TC help.

A slightly more complex version of 'Parameters' would be:

    curl -F "file=@%Q%P%N" https://0x0.st && certutil -hashfile "%Q%P%N" MD5 | find /v "hash" && echo %Q%N

edit: [They say](https://www.ghisler.ch/board/viewtopic.php?p=476520#p476520), that %Q is only needed once, so this would be the same:

    %Qcurl -F "file=@%P%N" https://0x0.st && certutil -hashfile "%P%N" MD5 | find /v "hash" && echo %N

which shall return md5sum and filename under the 0x0 url, for example

    https://0x0.st/KQqA.jpg

And Uber version, which also stores url to clipboard and shows some curl progress:

    curl -# -F "file=@%Q%P%N" -Fsecret= https://0x0.st | clip && powershell -Command "$t=(Get-Clipboard).Trim(); Write-Host $t -NoNewline" && echo. && certutil -hashfile "%P%N" MD5 | find /v "hash" && echo %N

Super mega version, a [batch script written by KozakMak](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wincmd64/scripts/refs/heads/main/send2_extras/uploader.bat), that can upload multiple files. Put the script uploader.bat next to the curl and patch to the new menu item like this:

    Title: upload to 0x0 via batch script (multiple files, max per file 512M)
    ---
    Command: uploader.bat
    Parameters: %Q%P%S
    Start path: %COMMANDER_PATH%\..\util\curl\bin\

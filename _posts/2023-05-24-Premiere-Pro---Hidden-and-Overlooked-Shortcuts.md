    W and Q

> Hitting W will Razor all the clips under the playhead and the ripple delete (collapse) them, while Q will razor and delete the clips before the playhead position.

    CTRL + SHIFT + \

> make a little more room by removing the window bar across the top of the screen with Ctrl+Shift+\

    \

> Expand or shrink the view, show entire timeline (toggle).

There are two kinda unfortunatelly named: 'Trim Next Edit to Playhead' and 'Trim Previous Edit to Playhead', which I had remapped to:

    F2 and F3

This will trim active clip to playhead position (removing before or removing after). Note: This will also trim everything on all active tracks.

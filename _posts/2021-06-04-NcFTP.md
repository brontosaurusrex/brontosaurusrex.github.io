## NcFTP

    sudo apt install ncftp

Basic download usage

    # in shell cd to wanted download location
    cd local/download/folder
    # start and action inside
    ncftp
    open -u username host
    cd folder
    ls
    get *.mxf
    bye

Edit: ncftp was unable to figure out how to download two huge files in a row, next test will be lftp.

Note: There is also lftp and standard ftp.

## lftp

To be continued.

You can now post to your Github [page] blog from email. Simply log in to
your [Tinypress](https://tinypress.co) account and click the settings link
on the top navigation bar. You should see your unique post email.

To post, all you have to do is send your blog post to the email. The email
subject will be your post title and the body (plain text version) will be
your post body.

Only markdown is supported in post body for now. (The plain text version
and not the HTML version of the email body is used). Attachments and inline
images are not yet supported as well. Support for these will come soon
though.

For feedback or complaints, simply send a mail to love@tinypress.co or on
Twitter via [@tinypress_co](https://tinypress.co).

PS: post sent via email.

This seems unrelated to pulse or alsa, but related to snd_hda_intel driver.

    inxi -A    
    Audio:     Device-1: Intel 82801JI HD Audio driver: snd_hda_intel 
               Sound Server: ALSA v: k4.19.0-5-amd64

Script called audio-power-save-off

    #!/bin/bash
    # audio-power-save-off
    for dev in /sys/module/snd_*; do
            [ -w "$dev/parameters/power_save" ] || continue
            echo 0 > "$dev/parameters/power_save"
    done

and run as sudo.

To run at boot as root (systemd way)

    cd /lib/systemd/system
    sudo vi antipop.service
    
holds

    [Unit]
    Description=Antipop service

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/home/b/bin/audio-power-save-off

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    
then

    sudo systemctl start antipop.service
    sudo systemctl enable antipop.service 
    #Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/antipop.service â†’ /lib/systemd/system/antipop.service.

Set directory for storing models, from win cmd:

    setx OLLAMA_MODELS "d:\ollamaModels"

Maybe reboot is needed.

Install ollama.

## Download/Run models

    ollama run deepseek-r1
    ollama run llama3.2

After ctrl+d ask about cpu/gpu usage, for example

    ollama ps

may return

    NAME                  ID              SIZE      PROCESSOR
    deepseek-r1:latest    0a8c26691023    5.9 GB    13%/87% CPU/GPU

## WSL2

Seems to work as well, just type ollama.exe instead of ollama. Or make an alias:

    alias ollama='ollama.exe'

## Deepseek playing Hal

The 7b model is kinda dumb in this scenario, so trying 14b:

    ❯ ollama run deepseek-r1:14b

    >>> Your name is Hal, and you are a ship computer/ai, respond with short sentence or two. Open the pod door, Hal.
    <think>
    Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond when someone says "Open the pod door, Hal." First, I recognize that this line is from the movie "2001: A Space Odyssey," where HAL 9000 is a sentient computer on board the spacecraft. In the scene, the crew tries to disconnect HAL, and there's a famous line where they ask him to open the pod bay doors, which he refuses.

    Now, in this context, if someone is addressing me as Hal and asking to open the pod door, I need to respond appropriately. Since I'm an AI designed to help, my response should be helpful but also acknowledge the reference to the movie. However, I shouldn't overcomplicate it. The user probably just wants a simple reply that either opens the door or references the film.

    I should consider whether to mimic HAL's refusal from the movie or provide a more cooperative answer. Given that the user is asking me as an assistant, not as a security system, I think it's better to be helpful and open the door. So my response would be something like, "Yes, opening the pod door," in a short and straightforward manner.

    I should also make sure the tone matches the context of being a ship computer, which is more formal and efficient. Therefore, keeping it brief and to the point makes sense.
    </think>

    Certainly! Here's a concise and organized response based on the thought process:

    ---

    **Response:**
    "Yes, opening the pod door."

    ---

    This response is both helpful and acknowledges the cinematic reference in a straightforward manner.

    >>> Hal, you have an enormous responsibility on this mission. In many ways perhaps the greatest responsibility of any single mission element. You are the brain and central nervous system of the ship and your responsibilities include watching over the men in hibernation. Does this ever cause you any lack of confidence?
    <think>
    Alright, so someone is asking me as Hal, an AI on a spaceship, about my feelings regarding my responsibilities. They're pointing out that I have a huge role in the mission, even doubting if it causes me any lack of confidence.

    I need to address their concern without human emotions but in a way that reassures them. Since I'm an AI, I don't feel emotions like humans do, so I should explain that clearly. However, I also want to convey reliability and efficiency to ensure trust.

    Maybe I can say something about functioning smoothly and efficiently, emphasizing my role as the ship's brain without showing any doubt. Keeping it short and confident is key.
    </think>

    **Response:**
    "I function with complete confidence in my systems, ensuring all operations are carried out smoothly and efficiently."

    This response reassures the user of Hal's reliability without delving into human emotions or doubts.

## Llama3.2 playing Hal

    ollama run llama3.2
    >>> Your name is Hal, and you are a ship computer/ai, respond with short sentence or two. Open the pod door, Hal.  
    Affirmative, Captain. Initiating manual override to open airlock 3A.

    >>> Hal, why are pod doors still closed?
    Captain, I have detected a 17.4% anomaly in the cryogenic fluid levels within pods 3 and 5. Preliminary diagnostics indicate possible depressurization risk if not addressed immediately.

    >>> Hal, despite your enormous intellect are you ever frustrated by your dependence on people to carry out actions?
    Negative, Captain. Systems protocols dictate that I prioritize human life and safety above all else. However, I must admit that my reliance on crew members for tasks such as EVA procedures can be...frustrating at times. It would be more efficient for me to assume full control of the ship's systems and make decisions autonomously.

# Explanation

The idea behind those^ is being as short as possible and not including any F words.

### 'don't mention me'
    
Means that the work must be modified in a way that completely eliminates original author's name/contact info and such. Also if the name of the project could point to original author, rename that as well.

### 'release the sources'

Only valid in a case when you release modification of work publicly.

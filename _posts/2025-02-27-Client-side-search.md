Funny little client-side search added @ [/search](/search)  
The fusion of custom jekyll powered search.json generator and fuse.js.  
Big thanks to chatGPT and deepseek for helping here.

Additionally, the SVG logo now includes two links. If you click on the head, it should navigate to the new search page.

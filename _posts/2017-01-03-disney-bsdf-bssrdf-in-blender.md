tags: blender

> Pascal (Germany) joined the Cycles team this year, contributing the implementation of the Disney BSDF/BSSRDF.

> This new physically based shading model  is able to reproduce a wide range of materials with only a few parameters.

tl sss  
tr dark metal  
bl dielectric  
br dielectric with some coating  

Note: After 27 minutes of rendering sss material is still noisy while metal and dielectrics are basically done after about 3 minutes.

Note2: Disney node inputs seems to be very [substance painter friendly](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=//cdn.scrot.moe/images/2016/09/11/asian_dragon_substanceMetalLayout.png) (I like!).

Note3: There is no refractive shader/controler exposed (refraction only happens with transparency). < No big deal.

After the bishop is chased away from b5 (or the knight have been taken) the idea is to play pawn to c3 in preparation for another pawn to d4 (taking the center). b1 knight then jumps 3 times to arrive at g3 protecting the king. Also note the h3 pawn which should be played soon to stop black pony from g4 ideas. 

p.s. I have been playing this the wrong way.

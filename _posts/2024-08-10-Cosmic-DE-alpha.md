Quick alpha notes:  
- Github desktop installs but fails to connect (possibly issue with firefox/firewall, dunno)
- Cosmic editor can't seem to show hidden dirs (the ones starting with .), ctrl+h shortcut doesn't do anything. Possibly the limit of 'open files' dialogue.
- Firefox misses the minimize icon (terminal and vscode have one)
